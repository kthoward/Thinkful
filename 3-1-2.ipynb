We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model?

We could then creat a training sample and a dependant variable (pays/does not pay) based on frequency of delinquent payments. We would then train the model and attempt to predict on a test set if the customer pays frequently or is frequently delinquent."
