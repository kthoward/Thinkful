-How do we decide which of the three products to market?
-Can we detremine whick will bring up the most profit and can we determine which will bring up the most traffic if not the same. 
-First look for margin of profit for each product by subtracting cost from price
-Also, look into which products draw the most attention from advertising
-Figure out which singular item would draw the most revenue in a month by combining the margin with the attention from advertisement
-Look into purchase patterns and see if any one item drew more attention to the site or was involved with multiple purchases. For example a dvd player being purchased and leading to dvd sales
-Now show which item would bring in most overall profit and also show which item would bring more attention to the site if not same.

-First off I would look at the most obvious which is comparing marketing spend to onboarding.
-Then dig deeper and see if marketing budget plays any role in how far along through the onboarding process the user gets. We would do this by comparing the ratios of initial contact to full sign up for different budgets. We can then now see if marketing can affect both initial interest and completion of onboarding.
-We will also look at where the signup process stalls and analyze why that certain step is such a roadblock. If the first two steps happen in quick succession and the third takes much longer we can then see if the ratio completing both first and second is also more successful.
-Hopefully now we can solve this by finding the optimal budget (one that creates the most successes without wasting money) and improve the step that is creating a roadblock if our analysis determines that there is one.

-We want to see which hotels will bring in the most profit and display them prominently.
-I would see which hotels are booked most frequestly and viewed most frequently. 
-I would then determine which have the highest booking rate and balance that with actual views and price of the hotel which I would assume also determines revenue.
-If there was an algorithm that I could build that would help me balance these three aspects of the hotel: conversion rate, views, profit/cost, I woulduse that to list the hotels.
-I would also be interested in which, if any, hotels create more return users. If there were only a few outliers then I wouldn't consider it but if there was a normal distribution of return users by hotel this could indicate that it is something we would want to consider.

-I would want to see how user behavior has changed from year to year. 
-I would compare the frequencies as well as legnth of time and also the number of users
-I would also look for users who havent logged in in a period of something like three months and I would see if any patterns occur before they drop off of the map. For example I would see if their duration on the website was steadily declining or if they just fell off out of nowhere.
-If there are any patterns in user behavior before they stop using the site we can attempt to include more features to discourage that behavior.
