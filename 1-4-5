PROBLEM:

How to increase Jedi public relations and attitude towards Jedi. Low approval rates for Jedis leads to misinformation and more sympathy for the dark side. We think that our messengers are not communicating as well as they should and need to pick elite messengers.

THE POTENTIAL SOLUTION:

Appoint an ambassador who will handle all public relations for the Jedi. 

THE METHOD:

Send Jar jar (a) and Mace Windu (b) to four planets each in an attempt to change inhabitants' perspectives of Jedi. Each will be given two friendly and two unfriendly planets and we will survey their opinions before and after interacting with the ambassador. Once the diplomats have returned from all planets assigned we will look to see who was the most successful at creating a more positive feeling towards Jedi. If the results are within the standard error we will send them out to attempt the experiment again.
