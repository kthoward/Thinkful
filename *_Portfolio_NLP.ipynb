      "﻿Evidence is piling up that much of the universe’s missing matter is lurking along the strands of a vast cosmic web.\n",
      "A pair of papers report some of the best signs yet of hot gas in the spaces between galaxy clusters, possibly enough to represent the half of all ordinary matter previously unaccounted for. Previous studies have hinted at this missing matter, but a new search technique is helping to fill in the gaps in the cosmic census where other efforts fell short. The papers were published online at arXiv.org on September 15 and September 29.\n",
      "Two independent teams stacked images of hundreds of thousands of galaxies on top of one another to reveal diffuse filaments of gas connecting pairs of galaxies across millions of light-years. Measuring how the gas distorted the background light of the universe let the researchers determine the mass of ordinary matter, or baryons, that it held — the protons and neutrons that make up atoms.\n",
      "“It’s a very important problem,” says Dominique Eckert of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, who has searched for the missing matter via X-rays emitted by individual strands. “If you want to understand how galaxies form and how everything forms within a galaxy, you have to understand the evolution of the baryon content.”  That starts with knowing where it is.\n",
      "About 85 percent of the matter in the universe is mysterious, invisible stuff called dark matter, which physicists have yet to find (SN Online: 9/6/17). Weirdly, about half of the ordinary matter is also unaccounted for. When astronomers look around at the galaxies in the nearest few billion light-years, they find only about half the baryons that should have been produced in the Big Bang.\n",
      "The rest is probably hiding in long filaments of gas that connect galaxy clusters in a vast cosmic web (SN: 3/8/14, p. 8). Previous attempts to find the baryons focused on X-rays emitted by gas in the filaments (SN Online: 8/4/15) or on the light of distant quasars filtering through these cobwebby strands (SN: 5/13/00, p. 310). But those efforts were either inconclusive, or were sensitive to such a narrow range of gas temperatures that they missed much of the matter.\n",
      "Now there might be a way to find the rest. Two groups — cosmologist Hideki Tanimura, who did the work while at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and his colleagues, and Anna de Graaff of the University of Edinburgh and her colleagues — have sought the missing matter in a new way. Both teams found a way to look through the gas all the way back to the oldest light in the universe.\n",
      "“Filamentary gas is very difficult to detect, but now we have a technique to detect it,” says Tanimura, now with the Institute of Space Astrophysics in Orsay, France.\n",
      "That ancient light, called the cosmic microwave background, was emitted 380,000 years after the Big Bang. When this light passes though clouds of electrons in space — such as those found in filaments of hot gas — it gets deflected and distorted in a specific way. The Planck satellite released an all-sky map of these distortions in 2015 (SN: 3/21/15, p. 7).\n",
      "Tanimura and de Graaff separately figured that there would be more distortion along the filaments than in empty space. To locate the filaments, both teams chose pairs of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey catalog that were at least 20 million light-years apart. De Graaff’s team chose roughly a million pairs, and Tanimura’s team chose 262,864 pairs. Both teams assumed that the galaxies were not part of the same cluster, but that they should be connected by a filament.\n",
      "The filaments were still too faint to see individually, so the teams used software to layer all the images and subtracted out distortion from electrons in the galaxies to see what was left. Both saw a residual distortion in the cosmic microwave background, which they attribute to the filaments.\n",
      "Next, de Graaff’s team calculated that those filaments account for 30 percent of the total baryon content of the universe. That’s surely an underestimate, since they didn’t examine every filament in the universe, the team writes — the rest of the missing matter is probably there too.\n",
      "“Both groups here took the obvious first step,” says Michael Shull of the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the new studies. “I think they’re on the right track.” But he worries that the gas they see might have been ejected from galaxies at high speeds, and so not actually the missing matter at all.\n",
      "Eckert also worries that the gas may belong more to the galaxies than to their intergalactic tethers. Future observations of the composition of the gas, as well as more sensitive X-ray observations, could help solve that part of the puzzle.\n",

      "[\"\\ufeffMany books about science are meant to be pleasure reading. Such books attempt to convey the wonder and fascination and excitement of science, and ideally some of the substance as well. After all, good popular science writing is not only engaging and entertaining, but also informative. But even very informative popular books are not designed to be fully educational about the science in technical detail. Popularization by its very nature requires omission of detail and simplification in description.\\nAs a result, many readers of popular science never get a true picture of how intricate and deep the corpus of scientific knowledge can be. For physics in particular, the “big ideas” conveyed via clever analogies and metaphors rarely reveal the richness of the mathematical foundations underlying them. It is equally rare for writers who do include equations to dissect them and analyze how they are derived. After all, most authors early on were advised of the old publisher’s axiom that each equation cuts a book’s sales in half.\\nFortunately for those who like their physics raw, with the math uncensored, publishers sometimes rescind the keep-equations-to-a-minimum rule for books that remain accessible to dedicated readers interested in physical reality’s mathematical foundations.\\n\\nOne such book,\\xa0Special Relativity and Classical Field Theory, is the third volume in Stanford University physicist Leonard Susskind’s “Theoretical Minimum” series. Previous volumes covered\\xa0classical physics\\xa0(SN: 4/20/13, p. 30) and\\xa0quantum physics\\xa0(SN: 6/14/14, p. 29). In the latest, Susskind (with Art Friedman) analyzes the mathematical apparatus of Einstein’s special theory of relativity, which describes matter in uniform motion, and the physics of fields, such as those explaining electricity, magnetism and associated phenomena.\\nAs in previous volumes, Susskind walks you through the basics of each topic and builds the necessary math from scratch. It helps if you’ve read the earlier books (especially the first, which focuses on classical mechanics). But either way, your prime requirement for getting much benefit from this book is comfort with sophisticated mathematics.\\nSusskind is meticulous in explaining each step of applying the equations to the physical phenomena he describes, and he excels in explaining why the math works the way it does. Nevertheless, if matrices and tensors and summation indices give you headaches, prepare for a migraine. If you’re intrepid enough, though, you’ll emerge with a much deeper appreciation for the true meaning of Einstein’s relativity, Maxwell’s equations and many other aspects of fundamental physics.\\nFor more detail (if perhaps less help), you could turn instead to\\xa0The Physical World, by English physicists Nicholas Manton and Nicholas Mee. They have composed a treatise of impressive scope, encompassing all aspects of fundamental physics in one nearly 600-page volume. They start with the laws of motion and move on to Maxwell’s equations and fields, special and general relativity, quantum physics, atoms and molecules, thermodynamics, nuclear and particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. Their text is straightforward and clear but dry and technical — equations are often embedded in a sentence as though they were words. It’s not a recipe for speed reading, but it is a thorough presentation of the rigorous math underlying a vast spectrum of natural entities and phenomena.\\nBoth books emphasize the importance of variational principles in describing nature, such as the principle of least action. As Manton and Mee stress, “least action” refers to a certain efficiency in how nature operates; the principle is in many ways more fundamental than some physical laws. It applies in vastly diverse contexts; it even helps bridge the divide between classical and quantum physics. It is conceptually superior in that many other facts of physics (such as laws of motion) can be derived from it. But there is a cost, as Manton and Mee note: the need for “more sophisticated mathematical technology.” It’s simply inescapable that understanding the physical world precisely requires a grip on math that cannot be achieved without considerable mental effort.\\nBoth of these books require such effort — they are not recreational beach reads. But they do make the rewards of deeper understanding attainable for anyone sufficiently motivated to pay the price.\\nBuy\\xa0Special Relativity and Classical Field Theory\\xa0or\\xa0The Physical World\\xa0from Amazon.com.

In independent work, researchers report that a fungus teams up with two types of bacteria\\xa0to fuel gut inflammation in people with Crohn’s disease. That work was summarized October 4 in\\xa0Digestive and Liver Disease.\\nTogether, the studies are part of a growing body of research indicating that relationships between the bacterial and fungal kingdoms can affect health, says David Andes, a fungal biologist at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison. Andes wasn’t involved in either study.\\nScientists have already described links between health issues, including obesity, and gut bacteria — often called the microbiome. But far less is known about the role of the gut’s fungal mix, or mycobiome.\\n“To get the whole picture,” says Andes, “we’re going to need to start looking at the mycobiome in addition to the microbiome.”\\nAs part of that picture, fungal biologist and pediatrician Cheryl Gale of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis wanted to know whether high-fat diets change fungal communities as they do bacterial mixes.\\xa0\\nGale’s team fed mice either standard mouse chow or high-fat chow. As expected, mice on the high-fat diet gained weight, and the mix of bacteria in their guts shifted.\\xa0\\xa0Firmicutes\\xa0bacteria associated with obesity increased, while\\xa0Bacteroidetes\\xa0bacteria decreased in abundance.\\nFungi changed too. Mice fed high-fat chow had less\\xa0Saccharomyces cerevisiae\\xa0yeast and more\\xa0Candida albicans\\xa0in their guts than did mice that ate standard chow.\\xa0S. cerevisiae\\xa0is a yeast used in making wine, beer and bread and has been associated with good health.\\xa0C. albicans\\xa0is an organism that causes many yeast infections.\\nGale’s team also discovered that relationships between bacteria and fungi changed when mice’s diets were changed. Her team can’t yet show a direct connection between the composition of gut fungi and obesity, but suspects that shifting interactions between bacteria and fungi might lead the host to gain weight.\\nThe results are “very, very preliminary,” Andes says. “There are lots of theories to test.”\\nMeanwhile, other researchers are investigating how a microbial triad might contribute to an irritable bowel syndrome. People with Crohn’s disease have an overabundance of\\xa0Candida tropicalis\\xa0fungus along with\\xa0Escherichia coli\\xa0and\\xa0Serratia marcescens\\xa0bacteria, say Christopher Hager and Mahmoud Ghannoum of Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland.\\xa0\\nWhen grown separately in lab dishes, the organisms “grew fine,” says Hager. “They formed nice little colonies. But when you mixed all three of them together, they just grew out of control. They form these intense, large robust biofilms.” Biofilms are structured microbial communities that can shield bacteria from antibiotics, making them hard to kill.\\nBy itself\\xa0C. tropicalis\\xa0grows as a harmless budding yeast, Hager says. But in the presence of bacteria, the fungus stretches out into long filaments. Electron microscopy showed that\\xa0E. coli\\xa0fuse to the fungal growths. Meanwhile\\xa0S. marcescens\\xa0make protein strings that somehow stabilize the biofilm. That’s good news for the microbes: Their partnership allows them to outcompete loner bacteria and fungi.\\nBut biofilms are bad news for the gut. Mice harboring the three organisms developed intestinal inflammation, a symptom of Crohn’s disease and other bowel disorders.\\nHager and Ghannoum propose that giving Crohn’s disease patients antifungal drugs and then adding beneficial fungi, such as\\xa0S. cerevisiae, could create a healthier microbe balance in the gut.\\nIt’s still too early for doctors to change their patients’ treatments based on these studies, says Andes. But a full understanding of health should include all the kingdoms of life, he says.\\n\\n', '\\ufeffHydrogen peroxide, a molecule produced by cells under duress, may be a common danger signal, helping to alert animals to potential harm and send them scurrying. New details from planarian flatworms of how this process works may deepen scientists’ understanding of how people detect pain, and may ultimately point to better ways to curb it.\\n“Being able to get a big-picture view of how these systems are built and what they’re cuing in on is always really helpful,” says biologist Paul Garrity of Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass.\\nAnd by finding\\xa0cellular similarities among planarians, fruit flies and people,\\xa0the new study, published online October 16 in\\xa0Nature Neuroscience, provides hints about how this threat-detecting system might have operated hundreds of millions of years ago.\\nThe results center on a protein called TRPA1, a well-known pain detector in people. Embedded in the outside of cells, TRPA1 helps many different animals detect (and ultimately escape) harmful chemicals, physical injuries and extreme temperatures. In humans, mutations in the\\xa0TRPA1\\xa0gene can cause syndromes marked by intense pain.\\nBut scientists have puzzled over TRPA1’s seemingly inconsistent behavior in different animals. In\\xa0Caenorhabditis\\xa0elegans\\xa0worms, for instance, the protein is activated by cold. But in other animals such as mosquitoes, TRPA1 is activated by heat. “The more people started looking at activation of TRPA1 in different species, the more the puzzle became complicated,” says study coauthor Marco Gallio of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.\\nGallio and colleagues studied TRPA1 behavior in the planarian\\xa0Schmidtea mediterranea, a type of simple flatworm that is evolutionarily far from humans and other animals typically studied in labs. Normally, planarians avoid hot areas. In an experiment, flatworms with the TRPA1 protein kept away from the parts of a chamber that were heated to 32° Celsius. But planarians without the protein glided around the entire chamber, seemingly unbothered by the heat. Likewise, the flatworms without TRPA1 seemed content to stay in a chamber laced with the chemical that gives mustard and wasabi their kick. Those results suggest that TRPA1 is involved, somehow, in planarians’ responses to cellular danger.\\nIn further tests, the researchers found that as the planarians were heated to harmful temperatures, their bodies produced more reactive oxygen species, chemicals that include hydrogen peroxide. And experiments with cells in dishes revealed that hydrogen peroxide directly activates the planarians’ TRPA1 protein.\\nHydrogen peroxide, or other reactive oxygen species, may serve as universal danger signals that TRPA1 detects, Gallio and his colleagues suspect. This general signal may explain a somewhat paradoxical property of TRPA1 that the researchers observed: Human TRPA1, which is activated by cold temperatures, allowed fruit flies to avoid hot areas, presumably by detecting hydrogen peroxide. The same was true for planarian TRPA1, which doesn’t directly respond to heat. That overlap in duty is possible because the protein isn’t responding to specific temperatures, but instead, to hydrogen peroxide, the researchers suspect. \\xa0\\nThe use of a chemical intermediate “really solves the mystery” of TRPA1’s seemingly variable behavior, Gallio says. With hydrogen peroxide as a chemical middleman, TRPA1 can detect a variety of temperatures and other danger signals, allowing TRPA1 to detect threats that are particular to different animals.\\nStudying TRPA1 in planarians offers insights about the evolutionary history of human pain sensing. Because the planarian lineage split from those of flies, mice and humans so long ago, it’s possible that an ancient common ancestor possessed a hydrogen peroxide‒sensing TRPA1 protein similar to that found in planarians. “Getting that perspective is terrific because you can get a very high-altitude perspective view of how evolution might be working,” Garrity says.\\n\\n', '\\ufeffTwo ultradense cores of dead stars have produced a long-awaited cosmic collision, showering scientists with riches.\\nThe event was the first direct sighting of a smashup of neutron stars, which are formed when aging stars explode and leave behind a neutron-rich remnant. In the wake of the collision, the churning residue forged gold, silver, platinum and a smattering of other heavy elements such as uranium, researchers reported October 16 at a news conference in Washington, D.C. Such elements’ birthplaces were previously unknown, but their origins were revealed by the cataclysm’s afterglow.\\n“It really is the last missing piece” of the periodic table, says Anna Frebel, an astronomer at MIT who was not involved in the research. “This is heaven for anyone working in the field.” After the collision, about 10 times the Earth’s mass in gold was spewed out into space, some scientists calculated.\\nUsing data gathered by about 70 different observatories, astronomers characterized the event in exquisite detail, releasing a slew of papers describing the results.\\xa0A tremor of gravitational waves, spotted by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, LIGO, on August 17, provided the first sign of the cataclysm.\\n“Already it is transforming our understanding of the universe, with a fresh narrative of the physics of stars in their death throes,” said France Córdova, director of the National Science Foundation, which funds LIGO.\\nA sequence of various types of electromagnetic radiation followed that gravitational trill, like musical instruments taking turns in a symphony. A burst of gamma rays segued into a glow of visible and infrared light, first spotted about 12 hours after the smashup. More than a week later, as those wavelengths faded away, X-rays crescendoed, followed by radio waves.\\nCombining gravitational waves with light from a neutron star merger is a long-held dream of astrophysicists. “The picture that you can put together by having all of those sources is synergistic,” says LIGO spokesperson David Shoemaker of MIT. “You can make inferences that otherwise would be impossible.\"\\nThat detailed picture revealed the inner workings of neutron star collisions and the source of brief blasts of high-energy light called short gamma-ray bursts. Researchers also calculated how fast the universe is expanding and tested the properties of the odd material within neutron stars.\\nFor astrophysicists, “this event is the Rosetta stone,” says LIGO member Richard O’Shaughnessy of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York.\\nLIGO’s two detectors, located in the United States, registered an unmistakable sign of the upheaval: A shimmying of space itself that continued for about 100 seconds before cutting off. It was the strongest and longest series of spacetime ripples LIGO had ever seen. At that point, scientists knew they had something big, says LIGO member Vicky Kalogera of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. “The e-mails that were circulated said, ‘Oh my God, this is it.’”\\nThat vibration was an indication of a cosmic crash: Whirling round each other as if on an ill-fated merry-go-round, two orbiting neutron stars spiraled closer and closer, until they converged. The neutron stars, whose masses were\\xa0\\xa0between 1.17 and 1.60 times that of the sun, probably collapsed into a black hole, although LIGO scientists were unable to determine the stars\\' fate for certain.\\xa0LIGO has previously spotted mergers of swirling black holes\\xa0with masses tens of times that of the sun (SN Online: 9/27/17); the smaller masses of the orbiting duo pointed the finger at neutron stars. And because black holes aren’t expected to emit light, the fireworks show that followed solidified the case for neutron stars.\\nLIGO’s sister experiment in Italy, Advanced Virgo, saw only a faint signal. That relatively weak detection helped narrow down where the convulsion occurred to “a part of the sky that was a blind spot of Virgo,” Kalogera says. That constrained the site to within a region of about 30 square degrees in the southern sky.\\nJust 1.7 seconds after the gravitational wave signal, NASA’s Fermi space telescope spotted a glimmer of gamma rays in the same neighborhood of the sky. Meanwhile, other telescopes swung into action, picking up a glow where none had been before. “We saw what looked like a new star,” says astronomer Edo Berger of Harvard University, who led a team that spotted the light with the DECam on the Blanco telescope in Chile. Berger’s was one of several teams that observed the blast’s light. That detection pinpointed the galaxy NGC 4993, 130 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Hydra, as the collision site. “There was this moment of disbelief: Wow, we actually did it. We found it,” Berger says.\\nThat afterglow also revealed an amazing story of stellar alchemy: With the stars’ death came the birth of elements. As the collision spurted neutron-rich material into space, a bevy of heavy elements formed, through\\xa0a chain of reactions called the r-process\\xa0(SN:\\xa05/14/16, p. 9). In this process, which requires an environment crammed with neutrons, atomic nuclei rapidly gobble up neutrons and decay radioactively, thereby transforming into new elements, before resuming their neutron gorgefest. The r-process is thought to produce about half of the elements heavier than iron.\\nScientists detected the characteristic glow of this process, called a kilonova, in follow-up observations. “Until this event, we had never directly seen anywhere in nature these heavy elements being forged. Now we have,” says Brian Metzger, a theoretical astrophysicist at Columbia University. “It is a feeling like you’ve discovered some kind of secret of nature.”\\nPreviously, astrophysicists disagreed about where the r-process occurs: Two top candidates were\\xa0exploding stars\\xa0called supernovas (SN: 2/18/17, p. 24) and neutron star mergers. Although scientists can’t yet say whether all r-process elements are produced in neutron star mergers, the amount such collisions should produce appears large enough to explain the abundances found in the universe.\\nAdditional riches were revealed by gamma rays. Scientists spotted a phenomenon called a short gamma-ray burst, a brief spurt of high-energy light, less than two seconds long. Such paroxysms are relatively common, appearing in the sky about 50 times a year. But finding their source is “a long-standing problem in astrophysics,” says theoretical astrophysicist Rosalba Perna of Stony Brook University in New York. The detection clinched it: Short gamma-ray bursts come from neutron star tête-à-têtes.\\nBy studying how the neutron stars spiraled inward, astrophysicists also tested the “squishiness” of neutron star material for the first time. This extreme substance is so dense that a teaspoonful of it would have a mass of around a billion metric tons, and scientists don’t fully understand how it responds when squeezed, a property known as its “equation of state.” Measuring this property could give scientists a better understanding of the strange material. Although the results couldn’t pin down whether the neutron stars were squishy, some theories that predicted ultrasquishy neutron stars were ruled out.\\nThe neutron stars’ union also gave researchers the opportunity to gauge the universe’s expansion rate, by measuring the distance of the collision using gravitational waves and comparing that to how much the wavelength of light from the galaxy was stretched by the expansion. Scientists have previously measured this property, known as the Hubble constant, through other means. But those measurements are in disagreement, leaving scientists\\xa0scrambling to explain the discrepancy\\xa0(SN: 8/6/16, p. 10).\\nNow, scientists have “a totally different, independent measurement,” says LIGO collaboration member Daniel Holz of the University of Chicago. The new measurement indicates that distantly separated galaxies are spreading apart at about 70 kilometers per second for each megaparsec between them. It falls squarely between the two previous estimates: 67 and 73 km/s per megaparsec. Though this collision can’t yet resolve the debate, future mergers could help improve the measurement.\\n“These are all just unbelievable, major advances,” Holz says. “It’s really been this insane thrill.”\\nThe excitement has yet to die down. Take it from astronomer Ryan Foley of the University of California, Santa Cruz, whose team was the first to spot visible light from the merger: “This is certainly the biggest discovery of my career and probably will be the biggest discovery of my entire life.”\\n\\n', '\\ufeffTeams of scientists are gearing up to race to the Antarctic Peninsula to find out what happens in the immediate aftermath of a massive ice calving event. In July,\\xa0a Delaware-sized iceberg broke off from Antarctica’s Larsen C ice shelf\\xa0(SN: 8/5/17, p. 6). Now, several research groups aim to assess the stability of the remaining ice shelf, map the region’s seafloor and study a newly exposed ecosystem that’s been hidden from the sun for up to 120,000 years.\\nFirst on the scene in November will be a team of scientists led by geophysicist Adam Booth of the University of Leeds in England and the U.K.-based\\xa0Project MIDAS, which\\xa0tracked the progress of the rifting from 2014\\xa0until the final break (SN: 7/25/15, p. 8). The researchers will conduct ground-penetrating radar and passive seismic surveys of the still-intact ice shelf, looking for shifts in the subsurface ice. They will also use GPS to monitor movements of the ice shelf.\\nThe goal is to track the dynamic response of the ice to the calving event, both short-term and long-term. Computer simulations suggest that the central part of the shelf will speed up, now that a piece of its buttress has been removed, says glaciologist Adrian Luckman of Swansea University in Wales, who will analyze satellite data as part of the effort. “What we need to keep tabs on now is whether the speedup will in any way destabilize what’s left. It might take many months to play out.”\\nMeanwhile, another team of scientists, led by marine biologist Katrin Linse of the British Antarctic Survey, is preparing for its own voyage in February. Linse and her colleagues’ urgent mission is to study seafloor that was in the shadow of the ice before the ecosystem changes. Now that sunlight can penetrate those waters and more food will be available, new creatures will begin to colonize the seabed.\\xa0\\nScientists have documented this transition before: In 2002, a Rhode Island‒sized chunk of ice\\xa0calved from a different ice shelf, Larsen B, along the Antarctic Peninsula\\xa0(SN: 10/18/14, p. 9). Five years later, a team of researchers investigated the seafloor species in the region once shadowed by ice. They found that\\xa0some pioneering critters had already moved in, taking advantage of the change in circumstances (SN: 9/7/13, p. 11).\\nLinse says her team aims to get there before those pioneers do. “For the first time, we can set a baseline on what lives under ice shelves,” she says. The group’s proposal was green-lighted on October 9, becoming the first team to get the go-ahead to rapidly investigate regions exposed by ice shelf retreat under\\xa0a new international conservation measure.\\nLinse expects to find something similar to ecosystems found in the deep sea — a dark, extremely food-sparse environment that spawns odd creatures such as carnivorous sponges and bivalves. “In the deep sea they have sponges that almost look like fly-eating plants, with long radials that are extremely sticky and catch anything that comes through the water column,” she says. But it’s also possible that the team will find nothing living there at all, she says. “That would be a very interesting result. [But] I expect to find life.”\\nIn addition to a marine biologist’s typical tools— water samplers to measure salinity and temperature, plankton nets — the team’s toolbox will hold cameras, coring systems to collect seafloor sediment, and hydroacoustic equipment to map the topography of the now-exposed seabed. “We only have satellite data giving us the seafloor depth,” which is an estimated 500 meters, Linse says. “We will be the first to get real data on the water depth.”\\n\\n', '\\ufeffRobert Klapper has examined scores of damaged and diseased human knees, hips and shoulders. But a visit to the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum introduced the orthopedic surgeon to the suffering of an extinct cat — and a scientific mystery. In 2000, Klapper took a break from his patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles to visit the nearby tar pits, where\\xa0myriad mammals and other animals\\xa0(SN: 5/17/14, p. 18) have been getting stuck for the last 40,000 years. (Yes, modern birds and insects still wander in.)\\nAfter examining a museum display of broad-snouted dire wolf (Canis dirus) skulls, Klapper made a beeline for the security guard and asked to see a curator. He badgered then collections manager Chris Shaw with questions about why the skulls looked so perfect\\u2009—\\u2009no signs of cancers, fractures or arthritis.\\n“Instead of throwing me out,” Klapper says, Shaw took Klapper into the bowels of the museum and pulled out a drawer of bones from saber-toothed cats (Smilodon fatalis), one of the abundant prehistoric animals preserved in the pits about 14,000 years ago. Klapper noticed a pelvis with a surface that reminded him of a medieval mace: One hip socket was spiky with sharp edges, a telltale sign of arthritis. At the healthy hip socket, the bone was billiard ball smooth.\\nThat kind of bone damage did not happen overnight. The arthritic animal had been disabled for years, Klapper estimated, perhaps even from birth. The surgeon asked a favor: “I’d love to get a CT scan.” Signing out the ancient cat’s pelvis, he says, was a thrill.\\nPaleontologists have long debated whether saber-toothed cats were solitary or social hunters. If this lame cat had been unable to hunt for years, which is what its traumatized hip bone indicated to Klapper, it could have survived only with help from other cats.\\nKlapper scanned that fossilized cat pelvis but left the images untouched for years, occupied with his hospital job and hosting ESPN Radio’s\\xa0Weekend Warrior, a health and sports program. Now, collaborating with Emily Lindsey, a paleoecologist at La Brea, Klapper plans to use more sophisticated radiology techniques to diagnose the deformity and possibly deduce clues about the cat’s lifestyle.\\nIt’s still early days for the revitalized project, Lindsey cautions, but “I’m really excited about it.” The museum houses some 2,000 fossils of saber-toothed cats, several of which the two plan to scan in the months ahead. \\xa0\\n\\n', '\\ufeffNo other science engages human curiosity like astronomy. From antiquity onward, attempts to comprehend the architecture of the cosmos have commanded a substantial fraction of humankind’s mental budget for intellectual endeavor. Only in the last century, though, have astronomers grasped the structure of the cosmos accurately. Just a hundred years ago, a great debate raged about the fuzzy patches on the nighttime sky known as “cloudy stars,” or nebulae.\\nSome astronomers believed that those cosmic fuzzballs resided within the Milky Way, the galaxy containing the sun and billions of other stars. In those days the Milky Way essentially comprised the known universe. But some experts suspected the nebulae to be very distant stellar systems much like the Milky Way itself — “island universes” populating the vastness of space. Skeptics argued otherwise, contending that the nebulae would be impossibly far away if they contained stars similar in brightness to the sun. In October 1917, the prominent astronomer Harlow Shapley reported that the brightness of novae in various nebulae would place some of them millions of light-years away, in conflict with other measurements of rapid internal motion within the nebulae. (At such large distances, internal motion would not be perceptible.) “Measurable internal proper motions,”\\xa0Shapley wrote, “can not well be harmonized with ‘island universes’ of whatever size, if they are composed of normal stars.”\\nThe centennial of Shapley’s paper is not being widely celebrated, of course, because he was wrong — distant nebulae are, in fact, island universes (the measurements of internal motion supposedly ruling that out turned out to be bogus). But there is another anniversary worth celebrating this year — the dodransbicentennial (or dodrabicentennial) of the founding of the Cincinnati Astronomical Society in 1842. That event is noteworthy for its connection to one of astronomy’s greatest mysteries: who first coined the phrase “island universe.” (A mystery that will be solved by the end of this blog post.)\\nOften that honor is attributed to the philosopher Immanuel Kant. But Kant wrote in German, and he didn’t use any phrase that could be translated as “island universe.” He was among the first to figure out the nature of the Milky Way, though. From ancient times, skywatchers had wondered at the eerie dim glowing band of light visible across the nighttime sky (until modern light pollution drowned it out). Galileo’s telescope revealed within the milky glow a vast population of stars too distant and dim to discern with the naked eye. More than a century afterward, in 1755, Kant reasoned that the Milky Way was actually a large lens-shaped disk, a system of stars (including the sun) analogous to the sun’s system of planets. In essence, the Milky Way was the universe, a grand collection of countless worlds — stars surrounded by planets, possibly inhabited. Kant further speculated that the Milky Way was not alone. Nebulae, it seemed to him, were too big to be merely dim fuzzy stars. He deduced them to be at a great distance (too far for their individual stars to be detectable), each of them another entire “universe” like the Milky Way.\\nBut he\\xa0didn’t call them islands. When he used the German word for island (Insel), he was referring to things like Jamaica, or an uninhabited planet. When Kant said “these elliptical figures are just universes,” the actual term he used in German was\\xa0Weltordnungen, which is literally translated as “world orders” (or in some places\\xa0Weltgebäuden\\xa0or\\xa0Weltsystemen, world systems).\\nKant was right about the nebulae; Edwin Hubble established the reality of island universes in the 1920s. Today, of course, they are called galaxies (although Hubble preferred “extragalactic nebulae”). Hubble credited the phrase “island universe” to the German naturalist and prolific popularizer of science Alexander von Humboldt, famous for his multivolume\\xa0Kosmos\\xa0(an attempt to survey the entire scope of scientific knowledge). Von Humboldt discussed the problem of the nebulae in Volume 3, published in 1850, referring to them in German as\\xa0Weltinseln. Hubble took that to mean “island universes,” and wrote that Humboldt used it in\\xa0Kosmos\\xa0in 1850 “presumably for the first time.”\\nBut as Hubble noted, the first English translations rendered\\xa0Weltinseln\\xa0literally, as “world islands.” “The transition to ‘island universes’ is an obvious step, but the writer has not ascertained the first use of the term,” Hubble wrote in\\xa0The Realm of the Nebulae. Modern historians have taken Hubble’s explanation at face value. In fact, though, von Humboldt was not the first to use the term\\xa0Weltinseln\\xa0to refer to the nebulae as distant galaxies. And the honor for first use of “island universe” in English belongs to a Union general of the American Civil War:\\xa0Ormsby MacKnight Mitchel, founder of the Cincinnati Astronomical Society.\\nMitchel was born in the Kentucky wilderness in 1809 (or 1810) but grew up in Lebanon, Ohio. With the aid of U.S. Postmaster General John McLean (who lived in Lebanon), Mitchel gained admission at age 16 to West Point. There he studied astronomy among other things (such as engineering), graduating in the same class as Robert E. Lee. Mitchel continued on at West Point to teach math and then served on active duty in Florida. But soon he returned to Ohio, studied law, worked for the railroad (as a civil engineer) and became a professor of math and astronomy at Cincinnati College.\\xa0\\nMitchel was slight and short (about 5-foot-6, and could have boxed as a featherweight) but was a dynamic lecturer, something of an astronomical evangelist. In 1842, after one of his lectures, he announced the 19th century version of a Kickstarter campaign: He planned to build the country’s best astronomical observatory in Cincinnati. Anyone who contributed (he asked for a $25 minimum) would become an original member of the Cincinnati Astronomical Society — and would be allowed to look through the new telescope. Money poured in, and Mitchel arranged for a top German firm to build a 12-inch refractor, bigger at the time than any other telescope in America. He managed to get the observatory built in time for the telescope’s delivery in January of 1845. One slight problem was the lack of funds for any observatory staff. But Mitchel decided he could run it on his own; his salary from the college was enough, he thought.\\nBut just days before the telescope arrived from Germany, Cincinnati College burned down, leaving Mitchel unemployed. He had a wife and seven kids. So Mitchel needed a new business model, quick. He decided on a three-pronged strategy: going on the lecture circuit, delivering talks on astronomy to audiences in several major cities around the country; writing books; and launching a new monthly astronomy magazine, with a subscription price of $3 per year:\\xa0The Sidereal Messenger. It was in this magazine that the English phrase “island universe” was first used (as far as anybody knows) to refer to the distant nebulae.\\nIn July 1847, for instance, Mitchel’s magazine referred to 10 nebulae in the constellation Ursa Major: “How wonderful is the thought that space is so richly strewn with these island universes,” he wrote. He also used the phrase in an 1847 lecture. “Next to the Milky Way, the object is to find what is beyond. Is there anything beyond? Have we reached the end? No; if we were there we should find 10,000 mighty island universes beyond, whose suns must be at least 1000 millions.”\\nBut the first appearance of “island universe” came in October 1846, in a long article by the eminent astronomer Johann Heinrich von Mädler. Mädler’s article refers to “our island universe (since, with reference to the distant nebulae, the entire combination of fixed stars within the Milky Way may be thus designated).” Credit for “island universe” does not therefore belong to Mädler, though — the article in\\xa0Sidereal Messenger\\xa0was Mitchel’s translation of a paper by Mädler published earlier in 1846 in\\xa0Astronomische Nachrichten. In the original German, Mädler used the term\\xa0Weltinsel\\xa0— world island — just as Humboldt did four years later in Volume 3 of\\xa0Kosmos. So it was Mädler, not von Humboldt, who first referred to nebulae as\\xa0Weltinseln, or world islands, and Mitchel who first rendered that phrase into “island universes.” (Unless, of course, he encountered the phrase from someone who used it earlier but left no trace in the annals of history or records accessible by Google.)\\nTo be fair, Mädler might have borrowed\\xa0Weltinsel\\xa0from von Humboldt. It turns out that von Humboldt had in fact used\\xa0Weltinsel\\xa0earlier — in Volume 1 of\\xa0Kosmos, published in 1845, the year before Mädler’s paper appeared. But in this place von Humboldt used\\xa0Weltinsel\\xa0just to refer to the Milky Way, not the far-off nebulae. And the English translator rendered it as “cosmical island,” not quite the same grandeur as “world island.” It is likely that Mädler would have read von Humboldt’s book; after all, it was von Humboldt who helped Mädler become an astronomer in the first place. In 1824, von Humboldt introduced Mädler to the wealthy banker Wilhelm Beer, who built an observatory for Mädler to conduct astronomical observations.\\nAs for Mitchel, he used the phrase “island universe” repeatedly in his writings and lectures throughout the 1850s. It was also used by other astronomers (such as Denison Olmsted of Yale, who referred to island universes in his Franklin Lectures of 1852) and was adopted by nonastronomers by the 1860s. The date of first usage recorded in the Merriam-Webster dictionary is 1867.\\nBut that was after Mitchel died. With the outbreak of the Civil War, Mitchel\\xa0was called to active duty\\xa0in the Union army as a general. (For some reason the troops nicknamed him “Old Stars.”) He commanded the Ohio volunteers for a while and led a raid that took control of Huntsville, Ala. He was later assigned to a post in South Carolina, where he promptly caught yellow fever and died, on October 30, 1862.\\nA few years later new observations showed some nebulae to be primarily gaseous, dashing the enthusiasm for nebulae actually being island universes full of stars. By the late 19th century most experts denied that other “universes” existed beyond the Milky Way itself. But it turned out that not all nebulae were alike, and some —\\xa0known as the spirals\\xa0— are in fact “island universes,” as\\xa0Hubble proved in 1923. And that will be another excellent anniversary to celebrate. \\xa0\\n\\n', '\\ufeffA seaweed-like marine invertebrate contains a molecule that has piqued interest as a drug but is in short supply: Collecting 14 tons of the critters, a type of bryozoan, yields just 18 grams of the potential medicine. Now, an efficient lab recipe might make bryostatin 1 easier to get.\\nMaking more of the molecule could help scientists figure out whether the drug — which has shown mixed results in limited clinical trials for cancer, HIV and Alzheimer’s disease — will pan out or bomb.\\nBryostatin 1, found naturally in a sea creature called\\xa0Bugula neritina,\\xa0has been studied as a potential drug for several decades. It interacts with an enzyme in the human body that helps regulate cell growth and control immune response. But finding a way to re-create the molecule in the lab, which would ensure a steady supply for research, has been a challenge. It’s a large, unwieldy molecule with a complex structure — multiple rings and lots of appendages with different chemical properties.\\nThe new recipe, reported in the Oct. 13\\xa0Science,\\xa0has so far produced more than 2 grams of bryostatin 1.\\nIt’s a big achievement, says Karl Hale, a chemist at Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland who wasn’t part of the study. Other scientists have created bryostatin 1, but only milligrams of it. The several grams produced by the new recipe is enough to supply numerous clinical trials, says study coauthor Paul Wender, a chemist at Stanford University.\\nTo build such a clunky molecule from simple chemical ingredients, Wender’s team fashioned the molecule in two parts through a series of chemical reactions, then linked the two together. The general reaction that links the two pieces together into one big molecule\\xa0has been used before\\xa0by other chemists working to synthesize bryostatin 1 and related compounds. But Wender says that his team’s approach works in a slightly different way.\\nThe whole process involved a lot of atom shuffling: adding on and removing different appendages, for instance, and forming and then breaking rings that would never make it into the final product. In total, the process takes 29 different chemical reactions — an improvement on the 57 steps previously reported because with each step, some material is lost.\\nOther bryostatins produced by\\xa0B. neritinahave similarly intricate structures with slightly different appendages, and also might have medical use. Scientists have re-created some of those in the lab, too, some through processes almost as streamlined as this one. But bryostatin 1 was important to make because it’s the only version of the molecule that has been used in clinical trials, Wender says. The process can also be tweaked to create bryostatin-like molecules that aren’t found in nature, but that might work better as drugs, he says.\\nBut not everyone is convinced that bryostatin 1 and its chemical relatives are still worth pursuing as a drug. Investigated as a cancer treatment for many years, the molecule didn’t turn out to be very effective against tumors, Hale says. And many patients reported severe muscle pain at the doses given for cancer therapy.\\nWender is an adviser for a company called Neurotrope BioScience that’s developing bryostatins and related molecules to treat Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. Results released earlier this year from a clinical trial in mid- to late-stage Alzheimer’s patients were “a bit of a mixed bag,” says Hale. Some patients on the lower dose of the drug saw some improvements on a cognitive test over those who got the placebo, but the small differences could have been due to chance.\\nGiving the drug at a different dose, or treating patients for longer or at an earlier stage of Alzheimer’s might yield better results, but “the jury is still out,” Hale says.\\nWender and others are also pursuing clinical trials for bryostatin 1 as a drug for HIV. An early-stage clinical trial published in 2016\\xa0showed that the drug was safe\\xa0but didn’t show any benefit against HIV at the low dose used. Expanding access to the compound should help speed up this sort of research.\\n\\n', '\\ufeffFor the first time, astronomers have directly measured the distance to a spot clear across the galaxy. The established but challenging technique promises a new way to map the structure of the Milky Way.\\nThis technique, called parallax, has measured distances to stars since the 1830s. But because of galactic dust in the way, it has been difficult to use parallax on stars on the opposite side of the galaxy. Other ways to measure distance are saddled with assumptions and uncertainties.\\nAlberto Sanna of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany, and his colleagues used the Very Long Baseline Array of radio telescopes in New Mexico to track a star-forming region in the outer Scutum-Centaurus spiral arm, which is on the opposite side of the Milky Way from the local arm where the sun resides. The scientists report in the October 13\\xa0Science\\xa0that\\xa0the region is more than 66,500 light-years away.\\nThe team observed the distant spot from March 2014 to March 2015, and drew an imaginary triangle between it and two points in Earth’s orbit. They then used trigonometry to measure the distance.\\n“Our measurement is essentially the same as a surveyor uses to locate points on the Earth,” says study coauthor Mark Reid of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. “It requires no model or assumptions.”\\nApplying the same technique to other regions of the Milky Way will help astronomers figure out what our galaxy looks like from the outside and compare it to other spiral galaxies.\\n“We predict that, within the next 10 years, we will be able to answer the question: What does the Milky Way look like?” Sanna says.\\n\\n']\n"

      "Many books about science are meant to be pleasure reading Such books attempt to convey the wonder and fascination and excitement of science and ideally some of the substance as well After all good popular science writing is not only engaging and entertaining but also informative But even very informative popular books are not designed to be fully educational about the science in technical detail Popularization by its very nature requires omission of detail and simplification in description As a result many readers of popular science never get a true picture of how intricate and deep the corpus of scientific knowledge can be For physics in particular the big ideas conveyed via clever analogies and metaphors rarely reveal the richness of the mathematical foundations underlying them It is equally rare for writers who do include equations to dissect them and analyze how they are derived After all most authors early on were advised of the old publisher s axiom that each equation cuts a book s sales in half Fortunately for those who like their physics raw with the math uncensored publishers sometimes rescind the keep equations to a minimum rule for books that remain accessible

Susskind walks you through the basics of each topic and builds the necessary math from scratch It helps if you ve read the earlier books especially the first which focuses on classical mechanics But

you re intrepid enough though you ll emerge with a much deeper appreciation for the true meaning of Einstein s relativity Maxwell s equations and many other aspects of fundamental physics For more

aspects of fundamental physics in one nearly page volume They start with the laws of motion and move on to Maxwell s equations and fields special and general relativity quantum physics atoms and

were words It s not a recipe for speed reading but it is a thorough presentation of the rigorous math underlying a vast spectrum of natural entities and phenomena Both books emphasize the importance of variational principles in describing nature such as the principle of least action As Manton and Mee stress least action refers to a certain efficiency in how nature operates the principle is in many ways more fundamental than some physical laws It applies in vastly diverse contexts it even helps bridge the divide between classical and quantum physics It is conceptually superior in that many other facts of physics such as laws of motion can be derived from it But there is a cost as Manton and Mee note the need for more sophisticated mathematical technology It s simply inescapable that understanding the physical world precisely requires a grip on math that cannot be achieved without considerable mental effort Both of these books require such effort they are not recreational beach

strands of a vast cosmic web A pair of papers report some of the best signs yet of hot gas in the spaces between galaxy clusters possibly enough to represent the half of all ordinary matter previously unaccounted for Previous studies have hinted at this missing matter but a new search technique is helping to fill in the gaps in the cosmic census where other efforts fell short The papers were published online at arXiv org on September and September Two independent teams stacked images of hundreds of thousands of galaxies on top of one another to reveal diffuse filaments of gas connecting pairs of galaxies across millions of light years Measuring how the gas distorted the background light of the universe let the researchers determine the mass of ordinary matter or baryons that it held the protons and neutrons that make up atoms It s a very important problem says Dominique Eckert of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching Germany who has searched for the missing matter via X rays emitted by individual strands If you want to understand how galaxies form and how everything forms within a galaxy you have to understand the evolution of the baryon content That starts with knowing where it is About percent of the matter in the universe is mysterious invisible stuff called dark matter which physicists have yet to find SN Online Weirdly about half of the ordinary matter is also unaccounted for When astronomers look around at the galaxies in the nearest few billion light years they find only about half the baryons that should have been produced in the Big Bang The rest is probably hiding in long filaments of gas that connect galaxy clusters in a vast cosmic web SN p Previous attempts to find the baryons focused on X rays emitted by gas in the filaments SN Online or on the light of distant quasars filtering through these cobwebby strands SN p But those efforts were either inconclusive or were sensitive to such a narrow range of gas temperatures that they missed much of the matter Now there might be a way to find the rest Two groups cosmologist Hideki Tanimura who did the work while at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and his colleagues and Anna de Graaff of the University of Edinburgh and her colleagues have sought the missing matter in a new way Both teams found a way to look through the gas all the way back to the oldest light in the universe Filamentary gas is very difficult to detect but now we have a technique to detect it says Tanimura now with the Institute of Space Astrophysics in Orsay France That ancient light called the cosmic microwave background was emitted years after the Big Bang When this light passes though clouds of electrons in space such as those found in filaments of hot gas it gets deflected and distorted in a specific way The Planck satellite released an all sky map of these distortions in SN p Tanimura and de Graaff separately figured that there would be more distortion along the filaments than in empty space To locate the filaments both teams chose pairs of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey catalog that were at least million light years apart De Graaff s team chose roughly a million pairs and Tanimura s team chose pairs Both teams assumed that the galaxies were not part of the same cluster but that they should be connected by a filament The filaments were still too faint to see individually so the teams used software to layer all the images and subtracted out distortion from electrons in the galaxies to see what was left Both saw a residual distortion in the cosmic microwave background which they attribute to the filaments Next de Graaff s team calculated that those filaments account for percent of the total baryon content of the universe That s surely an underestimate since they didn t examine every filament in the universe the team writes the rest of the missing matter is probably there too Both groups here took the obvious first step says Michael Shull of the University of Colorado Boulder who was not involved in the new studies I think they re on the right track But he worries that the gas they see might have been ejected from galaxies at high speeds and so not actually the missing matter at all Eckert also worries that the gas may belong more to the galaxies than to their intergalactic tethers Future observations of the composition of the gas as well as more sensitive X ray observations could help solve that part of the puzzle Fungi may affect gut health in unexpected ways new research suggests High fat diets may alter relationships between bacteria and fungi in mice s intestines contributing to obesity researchers report October in mSphere In independent work researchers report that a fungus teams up with two types of bacteria to fuel gut inflammation in people with Crohn s disease That work was summarized October in Digestive and Liver Disease Together the studies are part of a growing body of research indicating that relationships between the bacterial and fungal kingdoms can affect health says David Andes a fungal biologist at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison Andes wasn t involved in either study Scientists have already described links between health issues including obesity and gut bacteria often called the microbiome But far less is known about the role of the gut s fungal mix or mycobiome To get the whole picture says Andes we re going to need to start looking at the mycobiome in addition to the microbiome As part of that picture fungal biologist and pediatrician Cheryl Gale of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis wanted to know whether high fat diets change fungal communities as they do bacterial mixes Gale s team fed mice either standard mouse chow or high fat chow As expected mice on the high fat diet gained weight and the mix of bacteria in their guts shifted Firmicutes bacteria associated with obesity increased while Bacteroidetes bacteria decreased in abundance Fungi changed too Mice fed high fat chow had less Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast and more Candida albicans in their guts than did mice that ate standard chow S cerevisiae is a yeast used in making wine beer and bread and has been associated with good health C albicans is an organism that causes many yeast infections Gale s team also discovered that relationships between bacteria and fungi changed when mice s diets were changed Her team can t yet show a direct connection between the composition of gut fungi and obesity but suspects that shifting interactions between bacteria and fungi might lead the host to gain weight The results are very very preliminary Andes says There are lots of theories to test Meanwhile other researchers are investigating how a microbial triad might contribute to an irritable bowel syndrome People with Crohn s disease have an overabundance of Candida tropicalis fungus along with Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens bacteria say Christopher Hager and Mahmoud Ghannoum of Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland When grown separately in lab dishes the organisms grew fine says Hager They formed nice little colonies But when you mixed all three of them together they just grew out of control They form these intense large robust biofilms Biofilms are structured microbial communities that can shield bacteria from antibiotics making them hard to kill By itself C tropicalis grows as a harmless budding yeast Hager says But in the presence of bacteria the fungus stretches out into long filaments Electron microscopy showed that E coli fuse to the fungal growths Meanwhile S marcescens make protein strings that somehow stabilize the biofilm That s good news for the microbes Their partnership allows them to outcompete loner bacteria and fungi But biofilms are bad news for the gut Mice harboring the three organisms developed intestinal inflammation a symptom of Crohn s disease and other bowel disorders Hager and Ghannoum propose that giving Crohn s disease patients antifungal drugs and then adding beneficial fungi such as S cerevisiae could create a healthier microbe balance in the gut It s still too early for doctors to change their patients treatments based on these studies says Andes But a full understanding of health should include all the kingdoms of life he says Hydrogen peroxide a molecule produced by cells under duress may be a common danger signal helping to alert animals to potential harm and send them scurrying New details from planarian flatworms of how this process works may deepen scientists understanding of how people detect pain and may ultimately point to better ways to curb it Being able to get a big picture view of how these systems are built and what they re cuing in on is always really helpful says biologist Paul Garrity of Brandeis University in Waltham Mass And by finding cellular similarities among planarians fruit flies and people the new study published online October in Nature Neuroscience provides hints about how this threat detecting system might have operated hundreds of millions of years ago The results center on a protein called TRPA a well known pain detector in people Embedded in the outside of cells TRPA helps many different animals detect and ultimately escape harmful chemicals physical injuries and extreme temperatures In humans mutations in the TRPA gene can cause syndromes marked by intense pain But scientists have puzzled over TRPA s seemingly inconsistent behavior in different animals In Caenorhabditis elegans worms for instance the protein is activated by cold But in other animals such as mosquitoes TRPA is activated by heat The more people started looking at activation of TRPA in different species the more the puzzle became complicated says study coauthor Marco Gallio of Northwestern University in Evanston Ill Gallio and colleagues studied TRPA behavior in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea a type of simple flatworm that is evolutionarily far from humans and other animals typically studied in labs Normally planarians avoid hot areas In an experiment flatworms with the TRPA protein kept away from the parts of a chamber that were heated to Celsius But planarians without the protein glided around the entire chamber seemingly unbothered by the heat Likewise the flatworms without TRPA seemed content to stay in a chamber laced with the chemical that gives mustard and wasabi their kick Those results suggest that TRPA is involved somehow in planarians responses to cellular danger In further tests the researchers found that as the planarians were heated to harmful temperatures their bodies produced more reactive oxygen species chemicals that include hydrogen peroxide And experiments with cells in dishes revealed that hydrogen peroxide directly activates the planarians TRPA protein Hydrogen peroxide or other reactive oxygen species may serve as universal danger signals that TRPA detects Gallio and his colleagues suspect This general signal may explain a somewhat paradoxical property of TRPA that the researchers observed Human TRPA which is activated by cold temperatures allowed fruit flies to avoid hot areas presumably by detecting hydrogen peroxide The same was true for planarian TRPA which doesn t directly respond to heat That overlap in duty is possible because the protein isn t responding to specific temperatures but instead to hydrogen peroxide the researchers suspect The use of a chemical intermediate really solves the mystery of TRPA s seemingly variable behavior Gallio says With hydrogen peroxide as a chemical middleman TRPA can detect a variety of temperatures and other danger signals allowing TRPA to detect threats that are particular to different animals Studying TRPA in planarians offers insights about the evolutionary history of human pain sensing Because the planarian lineage split from those of flies mice and humans so long ago it s possible that an ancient common ancestor possessed a hydrogen peroxide sensing TRPA protein similar to that found in planarians Getting that perspective is terrific because you can get a very high altitude perspective view of how evolution might be working Garrity says Two ultradense cores of dead stars have produced a long awaited cosmic collision showering scientists with riches The event was the first direct sighting of a smashup of neutron stars which are formed when aging stars explode and leave behind a neutron rich remnant In the wake of the collision the churning residue forged gold silver platinum and a smattering of other heavy elements such as uranium researchers reported October at a news conference in Washington D C Such elements birthplaces were previously unknown but their origins were revealed by the cataclysm s afterglow It really is the last missing piece of the periodic table says Anna Frebel an astronomer at MIT who was not involved in the research This is heaven for anyone working in the field After the collision about times the Earth s mass in gold was spewed out into space some scientists calculated Using data gathered by about different observatories astronomers characterized the event in exquisite detail releasing a slew of papers describing the results A tremor of gravitational waves spotted by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory LIGO on August provided the first sign of the cataclysm Already it is transforming our understanding of the universe with a fresh narrative of the physics of stars in their death throes said France C rdova director of the National Science Foundation which funds LIGO A sequence of various types of electromagnetic radiation followed that gravitational trill like musical instruments taking turns in a symphony A burst of gamma rays segued into a glow of visible and infrared light first spotted about hours after the smashup More than a week later as those wavelengths faded away X rays crescendoed followed by radio waves Combining gravitational waves with light from a neutron star merger is a long held dream of astrophysicists The picture that you can put together by having all of those sources is synergistic says LIGO spokesperson David Shoemaker of MIT You can make inferences that otherwise would be impossible That detailed picture revealed the inner workings of neutron star collisions and the source of brief blasts of high energy light called short gamma ray bursts Researchers also calculated how fast the universe is expanding and tested the properties of the odd material within neutron stars For astrophysicists this event is the Rosetta stone says LIGO member Richard O Shaughnessy of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York LIGO s two detectors located in the United States registered an unmistakable sign of the upheaval A shimmying of space itself that continued for about seconds before cutting off It was the strongest and longest series of spacetime ripples LIGO had ever seen At that point scientists knew they had something big says LIGO member Vicky Kalogera of Northwestern University in Evanston Ill The e mails that were circulated said Oh my God this is it That vibration was an indication of a cosmic crash Whirling round each other as if on an ill fated merry go round two orbiting neutron stars spiraled closer and closer until they converged The neutron stars whose masses were between and times that of the sun probably collapsed into a black hole although LIGO scientists were unable to determine the stars fate for certain LIGO has previously spotted mergers of swirling black holes with masses tens of times that of the sun SN Online the smaller masses of the orbiting duo pointed the finger at neutron stars And because black holes aren t expected to emit light the fireworks show that followed solidified the case for neutron stars LIGO s sister experiment in Italy Advanced Virgo saw only a faint signal That relatively weak detection helped narrow down where the convulsion occurred to a part of the sky that was a blind spot of Virgo Kalogera says That constrained the site to within a region of about square degrees in the southern sky Just seconds after the gravitational wave signal NASA s Fermi space telescope spotted a glimmer of gamma rays in the same neighborhood of the sky Meanwhile other telescopes swung into action picking up a glow where none had been before We saw what looked like a new star says astronomer Edo Berger of Harvard University who led a team that spotted the light with the DECam on the Blanco telescope in Chile Berger s was one of several teams that observed the blast s light That detection pinpointed the galaxy NGC million light years from Earth in the constellation Hydra as the collision site There was this moment of disbelief Wow we actually did it We found it Berger says That afterglow also revealed an amazing story of stellar alchemy With the stars death came the birth of elements As the collision spurted neutron rich material into space a bevy of heavy elements formed through a chain of reactions called the r process SN p In this process which requires an environment crammed with neutrons atomic nuclei rapidly gobble up neutrons and decay radioactively thereby transforming into new elements before resuming their neutron gorgefest The r process is thought to produce about half of the elements heavier than iron Scientists detected the characteristic glow of this process called a kilonova in follow up observations Until this event we had never directly seen anywhere in nature these heavy elements being forged Now we have says Brian Metzger a theoretical astrophysicist at Columbia University It is a feeling like you ve discovered some kind of secret of nature Previously astrophysicists disagreed about where the r process occurs Two top candidates were exploding stars called supernovas SN p and neutron star mergers Although scientists can t yet say whether all r process elements are produced in neutron star mergers the amount such collisions should produce appears large enough to explain the abundances found in the universe Additional riches were revealed by gamma rays Scientists spotted a phenomenon called a short gamma ray burst a brief spurt of high energy light less than two seconds long Such paroxysms are relatively common appearing in the sky about times a year But finding their source is a long standing problem in astrophysics says theoretical astrophysicist Rosalba Perna of Stony Brook University in New York The detection clinched it Short gamma ray bursts come from neutron star t te t tes By studying how the neutron stars spiraled inward astrophysicists also tested the squishiness of neutron star material for the first time This extreme substance is so dense that a teaspoonful of it would have a mass of around a billion metric tons and scientists don t fully understand how it responds when squeezed a property known as its equation of state Measuring this property could give scientists a better understanding of the strange material Although the results couldn t pin down whether the neutron stars were squishy some theories that predicted ultrasquishy neutron stars were ruled out The neutron stars union also gave researchers the opportunity to gauge the universe s expansion rate by measuring the distance of the collision using gravitational waves and comparing that to how much the wavelength of light from the galaxy was stretched by the expansion Scientists have previously measured this property known as the Hubble constant through other means But those measurements are in disagreement leaving scientists scrambling to explain the discrepancy SN p Now scientists have a totally different independent measurement says LIGO collaboration member Daniel Holz of the University of Chicago The new measurement indicates that distantly separated galaxies are spreading apart at about kilometers per second for each megaparsec between them It falls squarely between the two previous estimates and km s per megaparsec Though this collision can t yet resolve the debate future mergers could help improve the measurement These are all just unbelievable major advances Holz says It s really been this insane thrill The excitement has yet to die down Take it from astronomer Ryan Foley of the University of California Santa Cruz whose team was the first to spot visible light from the merger This is certainly the biggest discovery of my career and probably will be the biggest discovery of my entire life Teams of scientists are gearing up to race to the Antarctic Peninsula to find out what happens in the immediate aftermath of a massive ice calving event In July a Delaware sized iceberg broke off from Antarctica s Larsen C ice shelf SN p Now several research groups aim to assess the stability of the remaining ice shelf map the region s seafloor and study a newly exposed ecosystem that s been hidden from the sun for up to years First on the scene in November will be a team of scientists led by geophysicist Adam Booth of the University of Leeds in England and the U K based Project MIDAS which tracked the progress of the rifting from until the final break SN p The researchers will conduct ground penetrating radar and passive seismic surveys of the still intact ice shelf looking for shifts in the subsurface ice They will also use GPS to monitor movements of the ice shelf The goal is to track the dynamic response of the ice to the calving event both short term and long term Computer simulations suggest that the central part of the shelf will speed up now that a piece of its buttress has been removed says glaciologist Adrian Luckman of Swansea University in Wales who will analyze satellite data as part of the effort What we need to keep tabs on now is whether the speedup will in any way destabilize what s left It might take many months to play out Meanwhile another team of scientists led by marine biologist Katrin Linse of the British Antarctic Survey is preparing for its own voyage in February Linse and her colleagues urgent mission is to study seafloor that was in the shadow of the ice before the ecosystem changes Now that sunlight can penetrate those waters and more food will be available new creatures will begin to colonize the seabed Scientists have documented this transition before In a Rhode Island sized chunk of ice calved from a different ice shelf Larsen B along the Antarctic Peninsula SN p Five years later a team of researchers investigated the seafloor species in the region once shadowed by ice They found that some pioneering critters had already moved in taking advantage of the change in circumstances SN p Linse says her team aims to get there before those pioneers do For the first time we can set a baseline on what lives under ice shelves she says The group s proposal was green lighted on October becoming the first team to get the go ahead to rapidly investigate regions exposed by ice shelf retreat under a new international conservation measure Linse expects to find something similar to ecosystems found in the deep sea a dark extremely food sparse environment that spawns odd creatures such as carnivorous sponges and bivalves In the deep sea they have sponges that almost look like fly eating plants with long radials that are extremely sticky and catch anything that comes through the water column she says But it s also possible that the team will find nothing living there at all she says That would be a very interesting result But I expect to find life In addition to a marine biologist s typical tools water samplers to measure salinity and temperature plankton nets the team s toolbox will hold cameras coring systems to collect seafloor sediment and hydroacoustic equipment to map the topography of the now exposed seabed We only have satellite data giving us the seafloor depth which is an estimated meters Linse says We will be the first to get real data on the water depth Robert Klapper has examined scores of damaged and diseased human knees hips and shoulders But a visit to the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum introduced the orthopedic surgeon to the suffering of an extinct cat and a scientific mystery In Klapper took a break from his patients at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles to visit the nearby tar pits where myriad mammals and other animals SN p have been getting stuck for the last years Yes modern birds and insects still wander in After examining a museum display of broad snouted dire wolf Canis dirus skulls Klapper made a beeline for the security guard and asked to see a curator He badgered then collections manager Chris Shaw with questions about why the skulls looked so perfect no signs of cancers fractures or arthritis Instead of throwing me out Klapper says Shaw took Klapper into the bowels of the museum and pulled out a drawer of bones from saber toothed cats Smilodon fatalis one of the abundant prehistoric animals preserved in the pits about years ago Klapper noticed a pelvis with a surface that reminded him of a medieval mace One hip socket was spiky with sharp edges a telltale sign of arthritis At the healthy hip socket the bone was billiard ball smooth That kind of bone damage did not happen overnight The arthritic animal had been disabled for years Klapper estimated perhaps even from birth The surgeon asked a favor I d love to get a CT scan Signing out the ancient cat s pelvis he says was a thrill Paleontologists have long debated whether saber toothed cats were solitary or social hunters If this lame cat had been unable to hunt for years which is what its traumatized hip bone indicated to Klapper it could have survived only with help from other cats Klapper scanned that fossilized cat pelvis but left the images untouched for years occupied with his hospital job and hosting ESPN Radio s Weekend Warrior a health and sports program Now collaborating with Emily Lindsey a paleoecologist at La Brea Klapper plans to use more sophisticated radiology techniques to diagnose the deformity and possibly deduce clues about the cat s lifestyle It s still early days for the revitalized project Lindsey cautions but I m really excited about it The museum houses some fossils of saber toothed cats several of which the two plan to scan in the months ahead No other science engages human curiosity like astronomy From antiquity onward attempts to comprehend the architecture of the cosmos have commanded a substantial fraction of humankind s mental budget for intellectual endeavor Only in the last century though have astronomers grasped the structure of the cosmos accurately Just a hundred years ago a great debate raged about the fuzzy patches on the nighttime sky known as cloudy stars or nebulae Some astronomers believed that those cosmic fuzzballs resided within the Milky Way the galaxy containing the sun and billions of other stars In those days the Milky Way essentially comprised the known universe But some experts suspected the nebulae to be very distant stellar systems much like the Milky Way itself island universes populating the vastness of space Skeptics argued otherwise contending that the nebulae would be impossibly far away if they contained stars similar in brightness to the sun In October the prominent astronomer Harlow Shapley reported that the brightness of novae in various nebulae would place some of them millions of light years away in conflict with other measurements of rapid internal motion within the nebulae At such large distances internal motion would not be perceptible Measurable internal proper motions Shapley wrote can not well be harmonized with island universes of whatever size if they are composed of normal stars The centennial of Shapley s paper is not being widely celebrated of course because he was wrong distant nebulae are in fact island universes the measurements of internal motion supposedly ruling that out turned out to be bogus But there is another anniversary worth celebrating this year the dodransbicentennial or dodrabicentennial of the founding of the Cincinnati Astronomical Society in That event is noteworthy for its connection to one of astronomy s greatest mysteries who first coined the phrase island universe A mystery that will be solved by the end of this blog post Often that honor is attributed to the philosopher Immanuel Kant But Kant wrote in German and he didn t use any phrase that could be translated as island universe He was among the first to figure out the nature of the Milky Way though From ancient times skywatchers had wondered at the eerie dim glowing band of light visible across the nighttime sky until modern light pollution drowned it out Galileo s telescope revealed within the milky glow a vast population of stars too distant and dim to discern with the naked eye More than a century afterward in Kant reasoned that the Milky Way was actually a large lens shaped disk a system of stars including the sun analogous to the sun s system of planets In essence the Milky Way was the universe a grand collection of countless worlds stars surrounded by planets possibly inhabited Kant further speculated that the Milky Way was not alone Nebulae it seemed to him were too big to be merely dim fuzzy stars He deduced them to be at a great distance too far for their individual stars to be detectable each of them another entire universe like the Milky Way But he didn t call them islands When he used the German word for island Insel he was referring to things like Jamaica or an uninhabited planet When Kant said these elliptical figures are just universes the actual term he used in German was Weltordnungen which is literally translated as world orders or in some places Weltgeb uden or Weltsystemen world systems Kant was right about the nebulae Edwin Hubble established the reality of island universes in the s Today of course they are called galaxies although Hubble preferred extragalactic nebulae Hubble credited the phrase island universe to the German naturalist and prolific popularizer of science Alexander von Humboldt famous for his multivolume Kosmos an attempt to survey the entire scope of scientific knowledge Von Humboldt discussed the problem of the nebulae in Volume published in referring to them in German as Weltinseln Hubble took that to mean island universes and wrote that Humboldt used it in Kosmos in presumably for the first time But as Hubble noted the first English translations rendered Weltinseln literally as world islands The transition to island universes is an obvious step but the writer has not ascertained the first use of the term Hubble wrote in The Realm of the Nebulae Modern historians have taken Hubble s explanation at face value In fact though von Humboldt was not the first to use the term Weltinseln to refer to the nebulae as distant galaxies And the honor for first use of island universe in English belongs to a Union general of the American Civil War Ormsby MacKnight Mitchel founder of the Cincinnati Astronomical Society Mitchel was born in the Kentucky wilderness in or but grew up in Lebanon Ohio With the aid of U S Postmaster General John McLean who lived in Lebanon Mitchel gained admission at age to West Point There he studied astronomy among other things such as engineering graduating in the same class as Robert E Lee Mitchel continued on at West Point to teach math and then served on active duty in Florida But soon he returned to Ohio studied law worked for the railroad as a civil engineer and became a professor of math and astronomy at Cincinnati College Mitchel was slight and short about foot and could have boxed as a featherweight but was a dynamic lecturer something of an astronomical evangelist In after one of his lectures he announced the th century version of a Kickstarter campaign He planned to build the country s best astronomical observatory in Cincinnati Anyone who contributed he asked for a minimum would become an original member of the Cincinnati Astronomical Society and would be allowed to look through the new telescope Money poured in and Mitchel arranged for a top German firm to build a inch refractor bigger at the time than any other telescope in America He managed to get the observatory built in time for the telescope s delivery in January of One slight problem was the lack of funds for any observatory staff But Mitchel decided he could run it on his own his salary from the college was enough he thought But just days before the telescope arrived from Germany Cincinnati College burned down leaving Mitchel unemployed He had a wife and seven kids So Mitchel needed a new business model quick He decided on a three pronged strategy going on the lecture circuit delivering talks on astronomy to audiences in several major cities around the country writing books and launching a new monthly astronomy magazine with a subscription price of per year The Sidereal Messenger It was in this magazine that the English phrase island universe was first used as far as anybody knows to refer to the distant nebulae In July for instance Mitchel s magazine referred to nebulae in the constellation Ursa Major How wonderful is the thought that space is so richly strewn with these island universes he wrote He also used the phrase in an lecture Next to the Milky Way the object is to find what is beyond Is there anything beyond Have we reached the end No if we were there we should find mighty island universes beyond whose suns must be at least millions But the first appearance of island universe came in October in a long article by the eminent astronomer Johann Heinrich von M dler M dler s article refers to our island universe since with reference to the distant nebulae the entire combination of fixed stars within the Milky Way may be thus designated Credit for island universe does not therefore belong to M dler though the article in Sidereal Messenger was Mitchel s translation of a paper by M dler published earlier in in Astronomische Nachrichten In the original German M dler used the term Weltinsel world island just as Humboldt did four years later in Volume of Kosmos So it was M dler not von Humboldt who first referred to nebulae as Weltinseln or world islands and Mitchel who first rendered that phrase into island universes Unless of course he encountered the phrase from someone who used it earlier but left no trace in the annals of history or records accessible by Google To be fair M dler might have borrowed Weltinsel from von Humboldt It turns out that von Humboldt had in fact used Weltinsel earlier in Volume of Kosmos published in the year before M dler s paper appeared But in this place von Humboldt used Weltinsel just to refer to the Milky Way not the far off nebulae And the English translator rendered it as cosmical island not quite the same grandeur as world island It is likely that M dler would have read von Humboldt s book after all it was von Humboldt who helped M dler become an astronomer in the first place In von Humboldt introduced M dler to the wealthy banker Wilhelm Beer who built an observatory for M dler to conduct astronomical observations As for Mitchel he used the phrase island universe repeatedly in his writings and lectures throughout the s It was also used by other astronomers such as Denison Olmsted of Yale who referred to island universes in his Franklin Lectures of and was adopted by nonastronomers by the s The date of first usage recorded in the Merriam Webster dictionary is But that was after Mitchel died With the outbreak of the Civil War Mitchel was called to active duty in the Union army as a general For some reason the troops nicknamed him Old Stars He commanded the Ohio volunteers for a while and led a raid that took control of Huntsville Ala He was later assigned to a post in South Carolina where he promptly caught yellow fever and died on October A few years later new observations showed some nebulae to be primarily gaseous dashing the enthusiasm for nebulae actually being island universes full of stars By the late th century most experts denied that other universes existed beyond the Milky Way itself But it turned out that not all nebulae were alike and some known as the spirals are in fact island universes as Hubble proved in And that will be another excellent anniversary to celebrate A seaweed like marine invertebrate contains a molecule that has piqued interest as a drug but is in short supply Collecting tons of the critters a type of bryozoan yields just grams of the potential medicine Now an efficient lab recipe might make bryostatin easier to get Making more of the molecule could help scientists figure out whether the drug which has shown mixed results in limited clinical trials for cancer HIV and Alzheimer s disease will pan out or bomb Bryostatin found naturally in a sea creature called Bugula neritina has been studied as a potential drug for several decades It interacts with an enzyme in the human body that helps regulate cell growth and control immune response But finding a way to re create the molecule in the lab which would ensure a steady supply for research has been a challenge It s a large unwieldy molecule with a complex structure multiple rings and lots of appendages with different chemical properties The new recipe reported in the Oct Science has so far produced more than grams of bryostatin It s a big achievement says Karl Hale a chemist at Queen s University Belfast in Northern Ireland who wasn t part of the study Other scientists have created bryostatin but only milligrams of it The several grams produced by the new recipe is enough to supply numerous clinical trials says study coauthor Paul Wender a chemist at Stanford University To build such a clunky molecule from simple chemical ingredients Wender s team fashioned the molecule in two parts through a series of chemical reactions then linked the two together The general reaction that links the two pieces together into one big molecule has been used before by other chemists working to synthesize bryostatin and related compounds But Wender says that his team s approach works in a slightly different way The whole process involved a lot of atom shuffling adding on and removing different appendages for instance and forming and then breaking rings that would never make it into the final product In total the process takes different chemical reactions an improvement on the steps previously reported because with each step some material is lost Other bryostatins produced by B neritinahave similarly intricate structures with slightly different appendages and also might have medical use Scientists have re created some of those in the lab too some through processes almost as streamlined as this one But bryostatin was important to make because it s the only version of the molecule that has been used in clinical trials Wender says The process can also be tweaked to create bryostatin like molecules that aren t found in nature but that might work better as drugs he says But not everyone is convinced that bryostatin and its chemical relatives are still worth pursuing as a drug Investigated as a cancer treatment for many years the molecule didn t turn out to be very effective against tumors Hale says And many patients reported severe muscle pain at the doses given for cancer therapy Wender is an adviser for a company called Neurotrope BioScience that s developing bryostatins and related molecules to treat Alzheimer s and other neurodegenerative diseases Results released earlier this year from a clinical trial in mid to late stage Alzheimer s patients were a bit of a mixed bag says Hale Some patients on the lower dose of the drug saw some improvements on a cognitive test over those who got the placebo but the small differences could have been due to chance Giving the drug at a different dose or treating patients for longer or at an earlier stage of Alzheimer s might yield better results but the jury is still out Hale says Wender and others are also pursuing clinical trials for bryostatin as a drug for HIV An early stage clinical trial published in showed that the drug was safe but didn t show any benefit against HIV at the low dose used Expanding access to the compound should help speed up this sort of research For the first time astronomers have directly measured the distance to a spot clear across the galaxy The established but challenging technique promises a new way to map the structure of the Milky Way This technique called parallax has measured distances to stars since the s But because of galactic dust in the way it has been difficult to use parallax on stars on the opposite side of the galaxy Other ways to measure distance are saddled with assumptions and uncertainties Alberto Sanna of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn Germany and his colleagues used the Very Long Baseline Array of radio telescopes in New Mexico to track a star forming region in the outer Scutum Centaurus spiral arm which is on the opposite side of the Milky Way from the local arm where the sun resides The scientists report in the October Science that the region is more than light years away The team observed the distant spot from March to March and drew an imaginary triangle between it and two points in Earth s orbit They then used trigonometry to measure the distance Our measurement is essentially the same as a surveyor uses to locate points on the Earth says study coauthor Mark Reid of the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics It requires no model or assumptions Applying the same technique to other regions of the Milky Way will help astronomers figure out what our galaxy looks like from the outside and compare it to other spiral galaxies We predict that within the next years we will be able to answer the question What does the Milky Way look like Sanna says The tropics of Asia Africa and South America all puffed out more carbon dioxide during the strong El Ni o than during the La Ni a new satellite data show Because El Ni o s warmer drier conditions in tropical regions mimic the effects of climate change expected by the end of the century those observations may be a sobering harbinger of the tropics diminishing role as a buffer for fossil fuel emissions SN Online The new findings come from NASA s Orbiting Carbon Observatory or OCO which launched in Five papers in the Oct Science describe some of the first data collected by the satellite which is giving scientists an unprecedented peek into how carbon moves between land atmosphere and oceans Atmospheric scientist Junjie Liu of NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena Calif and her colleagues report that the tropics of Asia Africa and South America together released about gigatons more carbon into the atmosphere in than they did in a cooler and wetter La Ni a year For comparison the United States released gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere in The cause of those anomalies varied by region the researchers discovered when they looked more closely at OCO and other satellite data showing changes in biological productivity carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere and other measurements In Asia an increase in biomass burning was primarily responsible for the extra carbon release But the carbon bumps in Africa and South America were attributable to El Ni o the researchers report In Africa higher temperatures drove the larger release of carbon by increasing the rate of plant respiration In South America lower precipitation which reduces the growth of plants was largely responsible Both conditions mimic climate changes expected to occur by the end of the century The brain s mapmakers don t get a break even for sleep Grid cells specialized nerve cells that help keep people and other animals oriented stay on the clock two preliminary studies on rats suggest Results from the studies both posted October at bioRxiv org highlight the stability of the brain s inner GPS system Nestled in a part of the brain called the medial entorhinal cortex grid cells fire off regularly spaced signals as a rat moves through the world marking a rat s various locations Individual grid cells work together to create a mental map of the environment But scientists didn t know what happens to this map when an animal no longer needs it such as during sleep Grid cells it turns out maintain their mapmaking relationships even in sleeping rats report two teams of researchers one from the University of Texas at Austin and one from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim The Norway group includes the researchers who won a Nobel Prize in for discovering grid cells SN Online By eavesdropping on pairs of grid cells researchers found that the cells maintain similar relationships to each other during sleep as they do during active exploration For instance two grid cells that fired off signals nearly in tandem while the rat was awake kept that same pattern during sleep a sign that the map is intact The results provide insights into how grid cells work together to create durable mental maps Over the last years the number of kids and teens with obesity has skyrocketed worldwide In an estimated million girls and million boys were obese By those numbers had risen to an estimated million girls and million boys according to a report published online October in the Lancet While the increase in childhood obesity has slowed or leveled off in many high income countries it continues to grow in other parts of the world especially in Asia Using the body mass index a ratio of weight to height of more than million to year olds researchers tracked trends from to in five weight categories moderate to severe underweight mild underweight healthy weight overweight and obesity The researchers defined obesity as having a BMI around or higher for a year old up to around or higher for a year old Globally more kids and teens an estimated million boys and million girls were moderately or severely underweight in than were obese But the total number of obese children is expected to overtake the moderately or severely underweight total by the researchers say The globalization of poor diet and inactivity is part of the problem says William Dietz a pediatrician at George Washington University in Washington D C who wrote a commentary that accompanies the study Processed foods and sugary drinks have become widely available around the world And urbanization which also increased in the last four decades tends to reduce physical activity Dietz says While obesity rates for kids and teens have largely leveled off in most wealthy countries those numbers continue to increase for adults The findings in children are consistent with evidence showing a drop in the consumption of fast food among children and adults in the United States over the last decade Dietz says Children are going to be much more susceptible to changes in caloric intake than adults Modern people of European and Asian ancestry carry slightly more Neandertal DNA than previously realized About to percent of DNA in non Africans is an heirloom of ancient human Neandertal interbreeding researchers report online October in Science That corresponds to to percent more Neandertal ancestry than previous estimates and it may carry consequences for human health and behavior say paleogeneticist Janet Kelso of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig Germany and colleagues Analysis of DNA from an about year old Neandertal woman from Vindija Cave in Croatia allowed Kelso and colleagues to find the extra ancestry contribution Among the gene variants modern humans inherited from Neandertals are ones associated with higher cholesterol increased belly fat rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia researchers learned from analysis of the new Neandertal DNA An increased risk of sunburning as a child and a propensity to be an evening person may also be Neandertal legacies Kelso and Max Planck colleague Michael Dannemann report in a separate study published October in the American Journal of Human Genetics Their analysis which used DNA data from a Neandertal woman from the Altai Mountains in Siberia SN p and present day British people confirmed some links between Neandertal heritage and human diseases made by previous studies SN p but didn t find evidence that Neandertal gene variants contribute to obesity Haumea can do the hula hoop The egg shaped dwarf planet is the first object beyond Neptune to be spotted sporting a ring of particles It now appears that rings can be common in the outer solar system says Jose Luis Ortiz of the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia in Granada Spain On January Ortiz and colleagues used telescopes at observatories to peer into the Kuiper Belt a region of icy objects beyond the orbit of Neptune and watch Haumea block the light of a distant star That tiny eclipse let the team measure the dwarf planet s size shape and surrounding environment more accurately than ever before Haumea turned out to be larger its long axis stretches at least kilometers a bit more than half the width of the contiguous United States and less dense than previously thought the team reports October in Nature To their surprise the researchers also saw the background star flicker before and after its light was blocked by Haumea itself That flicker is consistent with a kilometer wide ring about kilometers above the dwarf planet s surface The ring is probably made of rock and ice Ortiz says but more observations are needed to know for sure It could be debris kicked up by impacts from small stray space rocks or even just from the dwarf planet s spinning Haumea twirls unusually fast completing a rotation once every hours which could help fling particles into orbit Until recently the four giant planets Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune were the only solar system bodies known to have rings Then in and astronomers spotted rings around the tiny planetoids Chariklo SN p and Chiron suggesting that small bodies could hold on to rings too Both of those small worlds are known as centaurs objects whose orbits take them between Jupiter and Neptune although they may be interlopers from the more distant Kuiper Belt Since recent searches for rings around Pluto came up empty SN Online no object farther away than Neptune seemed to have rings Some astronomers speculated that something about the Kuiper Belt disrupted rings around small worlds there or that the centaurs got their rings as part of the process that kicked them into their current orbits Haumea s ring suggests that such structures can form and survive at the solar system s fringes after all This discovery does disrupt that tidy narrative says Matthew Tiscareno of the SETI Institute in Mountain View Calif who studies Saturn s rings but was not involved in the new study Reality is more complicated that is interesting The deep waters of the East Pacific hold an unprepossessing treasure trove potato sized lumps of rock that contain valuable metals such as manganese cobalt and copper Turns out such manganese nodules are home to another kind of goody a species of sponge never before seen researchers report online September in Systematics and Biodiversity These newly discovered nodule dwellers may help scientists monitor the impact of future deep sea mining Little is known about life in the abyssal depths of the ocean to meters down But the prospect of mining in those depths is looming For example the United Nation s International Seabed Authority has granted exploration contracts for mining manganese nodules To track how mining will affect deep sea ecosystems over time scientists are eager to establish a baseline of existing biodiversity in regions such as the Clarion Clipperton Zone CCZ an area in the eastern Pacific Ocean littered with the nodules The new sponge species may be the key to that baseline Zoologist Swee Cheng Lim of the National University of Singapore and colleagues examined samples of manganese nodules retrieved from the CCZ in that were covered in snow white patches of sponge Based on the sponges unusual star shaped spicules skeletal parts that support the sponge s soft tissues the team suspected they d found a new species DNA analyses confirmed it Dubbed Plenaster craigi this species proximity to the nodules may make it the perfect canary in the coal mine A founding father of behavioral economics a research school that has popularized the practice of nudging people into making decisions that authorities deem to be in their best interests has won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business received the award October for being the leader of a discipline that has championed the idea of humans not as purely rational and selfish as long posited by economists Instead he argues we are driven by simple often emotionally fueled assumptions that can lead us astray Richard Thaler has pioneered the analysis of ways in which human decisions systematically deviate from traditional economic models says cognitive scientist Peter G rdenfors of Lund University Sweden a member of the Economic Sciences Prize Committee Thaler argues that even if people try to make good economic choices our thinking abilities are limited In dealing with personal finances for instance he finds that most people mentally earmark money into different accounts say for housing food vacations and entertainment That can lead to questionable decisions such as saving for a vacation in a low interest savings account while buying household goods with a high interest credit card At an October news conference at the University of Chicago Thaler referenced mental accounting in describing what he would do with the roughly million award Every time I spend any money on something fun I ll say it came from the Nobel Prize Thaler s research has also focused on how judgments about fairness such as sudden jumps in the prices of consumer items affect people s willingness to buy those items A third area of his research finds that people s short term desires often override long term plans A classic example consists of putting off saving for retirement until later in life That research in particular inspired his book Nudge Improving Decisions about Health Wealth and Happiness coauthored by Cass Sunstein now at Harvard Law School Nudging also known as libertarian paternalism is a way for public and private institutions to prod people to make certain decisions SN p For instance employees more often start saving for retirement early in their careers when offered savings plans that they must opt out of Many governments including those of the United Kingdom and the United States have funded teams of behavioral economists called nudge units to develop ways to nudge people to say apply for government benefits or comply with tax laws A total of nudge units now exist worldwide Thaler said at the news conference Nudging has its roots in a line of research dubbed heuristics and biases launched in the s by two psychologists economics Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University and the late Amos Tversky of Stanford University Investigators in heuristics and biases contend that people can t help but make many types of systematic thinking errors such as being overconfident in their decisions Thaler like Kahneman views the mind as consisting of one system for making rapid intuitive decisions that are often misleading and a second system for deliberating slowly and considering as much relevant information as possible Despite the influence of Thaler s ideas on research and social policy they are controversial among decision researchers SN p Some argue that nudging overlooks the power of simple rules of thumb for making decisions that people can learn to wield on their own I don t think I ve changed everybody s minds Thaler said But many young economists embrace behavioral economics A new discovery is turning the hemispheric history of a mysterious whale species upside down Two fossils recently unearthed in Italy and Japan suggest that a southern whale was briefly a denizen of northern waters more than half a million years ago Until now all available evidence suggested that the pygmy right whale Caperea marginata and its ancestors have been steadfast Southern Hemisphere residents for the past million years Pygmy right whales are so rarely sighted that scientists know very little about their lifestyle and the fossil record is sparse too The new Northern Hemisphere fossils both closely resemble other confirmed specimens of the whales researchers report October in Current Biology The fossils include a fragmented skull with ear bones dating to to million years ago and a bone containing parts of the middle and inner ear that s million to million years old Glaciation near the South Pole during the Pleistocene Ice Age may have temporarily pushed Capereafurther north the researchers propose Then as the glaciers melted the whale migrated south again Because the new fossils are separated in age by about a million years it s hard to say whether the whales crossed the equator multiple times or briefly established a longer term population in the Northern Hemisphere Antibiotics may have a new teammate in the fight against drug resistant infections Researchers have engineered nanoparticles to produce chemicals that render bacteria more vulnerable to antibiotics These quantum dots described online October in Science Advances could help combat pathogens that have developed resistance to antibiotics SN p Various superbugs are evolving too rapidly to be counteracted by traditional drugs says Zhengtao Deng a chemist at Nanjing University in China not involved in the research Drug resistant infections will kill an extra million people a year worldwide by unless action is taken In the study antibiotics spiked with quantum dots fought off bacteria as effectively as times as much antibiotic alone That s really impressive says Chao Zhong a materials scientist at ShanghaiTech University who was not involved in the study This is a really comprehensive study Quantum dots previously investigated as a tool to trace drug delivery throughout the body or to take snapshots of cells are made of semiconductors the same kind of material in such electronics as laptops and cell phones SN p The new quantum dots are tiny chunks of cadmium telluride just nanometers across or about as wide as a strand of DNA When illuminated by a specific frequency of green light the nanoparticles electrons can pop off and glom onto nearby oxygen molecules which are dissolved in water throughout the body to create a chemical called superoxide When a bacterial cell absorbs this superoxide it throws the microbe s internal chemistry so off balance that the pathogen can t defend itself against antibiotics explains study coauthor Anushree Chatterjee a chemical engineer at the University of Colorado Boulder Chatterjee and colleagues mixed various amounts of quantum dots into different concentrations of each of five antibiotics and then added these concoctions to samples of five drug resistant bacterial strains such as Salmonella and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA In more than percent of tests of different antibiotic combinations on different bacteria the researchers found that lower doses of antibiotics were required to kill or curb the growth of bacteria when the medicine was combined with quantum dots One limitation of this treatment is that the green light that activates the nanoparticles can shine through only a few millimeters of flesh says coauthor Prashant Nagpal a chemical engineer also at the University of Colorado Boulder So these quantum dots could probably be used only to treat skin or accessible wound infections The researchers are now designing nanoparticles that absorb infrared light which can pass through the body That could be really effective in deep tissue and bone infections Nagpal says Late Stone Age people got a grip thanks to honeybees Northern Europeans attached a barbed bone point to a handle of some kind with a beeswax adhesive around years ago scientists say The result a fishing spear Using beeswax glue to make tools was common in Africa as early as years ago SN p But this spear is the first evidence of its use in cold parts of Europe at a time toward the end of the Stone Age when the glaciers were receding say archaeologist Michael Baales of LWL Arch ologie f r Westfalen in Olpe Germany and his colleagues Where the beeswax came from remains a question Honeybees may have pushed north into Europe from warmer Mediterranean locales several thousand years earlier than previously thought the researchers propose in the October Antiquity Farmers in Southwest Asia and Europe acquired beeswax and probably honey as early as years ago SN p Or Northern European hunter gatherers may instead have obtained beeswax through trade networks extending to Mediterranean areas Baales team says Stone Age Eurasians formed group alliances over large areas SN Online New chemical and microscopic analyses of the bone point discovered in western Germany in the s identified beeswax mixed with crushed charcoal Charcoal kept the beeswax from becoming brittle the investigators suspect The experience of reading the essays that make up The River of Consciousness is very much like peering into an ever changing stream Pebbles shift as the water courses by revealing unexpected facets below The essays by neurologist Oliver Sacks and arranged into an anthology two weeks before his death in meander through such topics as evolution memory and scientific progress Most have been published before But by bringing these quirky personal and curious essays together Sacks invites readers into his mind where they can experience the world from his unusually insightful perspective Some essays are long some short Some take a biographical bent while others focus more on scientific principles Many explore lesser known fascinations of scientific luminaries Charles Darwin s intense study of flowers the reader learns provided some of the best evidence for his theory of evolution And then of course there are Sacks own observations As his death neared he wrote of his fading hearing perceiving a story about a big time publicist diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as a story about a cuttlefish He began keeping a notebook of these mishearings recording what he heard what was actually said and people s reactions Other bodily sensations set his curiosity loose such as when he hurt his leg in an accident Nerve injuries and immobilization temporarily turned his leg into a stranger no longer part of his body Dismissed by his surgeon Sacks turned to historical literature to find examples of this alien limb sensation Some of the most compelling stories arise when Sacks scrutinizes his own mind He has a detailed memory of a bomb dropping in his London backyard during World War II At the time though he was at boarding school Sacks had co opted the memory from a letter from his brother who had written a vivid account of the incident We as human beings are landed with memories which have fallibilities frailties and imperfections but also great flexibility and creativity he writes The same could be said for the scientific endeavor as a whole Sacks argues Like ever evolving flowers malleable memories and fluid perceptions ideas are not fixed he writes Ideas like living creatures may arise and flourish going in all directions or abort and become extinct in completely unpredictable ways A new robot has the mobility of R D and the manners of C PO This knee high self driving bot abides by social protocols as it weaves through foot traffic keep right pass left respect others personal space The machine presented at the IEEE RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems in Vancouver on September paves the way for robots that could one day navigate sidewalks to make deliveries or transport people through hospital hallways Programming a polite mobile bot is different from designing a self driving car says Michael Everett a mechanical engineer at MIT Unlike the rigid rules of the road the rules that humans follow when they re walking around are pretty loose Building a bot that s light on its wheels among individuals with highly unpredictable paths is a totally different ball game he says Everett and colleagues decked out their rover with webcams and a depth sensor then taught the bot how to behave by running it through thousands of simulated scenarios After several hours of training the robot could cruise at walking speed down a busy hallway without tripping up anyone nearby A new model of atomic clock is now the world s steadiest metronome with a tick rate about six times more precise than the previous record holder This souped up clock is an optical lattice it measures time by counting the oscillations of light in a laser beam which happen about trillion times per second Strontium atoms in the clock tick off each oscillation by absorbing and re emitting this light Previous optical lattices held strontium atoms in a queue of pancake shaped gas clouds where atoms were liable to bump into each other which could make them lose their rhythm SN p That limited the precision of the clock s measurements In the new clock described in the Oct Science researchers meticulously assembled atoms in a gridlike structure like eggs in egg cartons stacked on top of each other explains study coauthor Benjamin Bloom a quantum engineer at Rigetti Computing in Berkeley Calif Thanks to weird laws of quantum mechanics atoms locked in this rigid configuration can t jostle each other The arrangement helped to match the duration of each of the clock s ticks After running the clock for an hour each tick lasted the exact same amount of time as the rest give or take a couple quadrillionths of a second The clock s predecessor could guarantee its ticks were identical only down to about quadrillionths of a second SN p But just because the newfangled clock boasts extremely consistent ticks doesn t necessarily mean it doesn t tick too fast or too slow says coauthor Jun Ye a physicist at JILA an institute jointly operated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the University of Colorado Boulder To make sure this next gen atomic clock keeps accurate time in the long run Ye and colleagues must now compare it with other atomic clocks Extremely precise accurate timekeeping can help scientists improve their definitions for standard units of measure It can also help physicists spot incredibly small differences in how fast time elapses in various places says Paul Eric Pottie a physicist at the Paris Observatory who was not involved in the study This could help scientists catch gravitational waves rippling through space since any variation could indicate that gravity is warping time differently in different spots Neonicotinoid pesticides are turning up in honey on every continent with honeybees The first global honey survey testing for these controversial nicotine derived pesticides shows just how widely honeybees are exposed to the chemicals which have been shown to affect the health of bees and other insects Three out of four honey samples tested contained measurable levels of at least one of five common neonicotinoids researchers report in the Oct Science On the global scale the contamination is really striking says study coauthor Edward Mitchell a soil biologist at the University of Neuch tel in Switzerland The pesticides are used on many kinds of crops grown in different climates but traces of the chemicals showed up even in honey from remote islands with very little agriculture I used to think of neonicotinoids as being a localized problem next to a small set of crops says Amro Zayed who studies bees at York University in Toronto and wasn t involved in the research These pesticides are much more prevalent than I previously thought Mitchell and his team crowdsourced honey samples from around the world asking friends and colleagues to send local honey from their home countries or vacation destinations The presence of pesticides varied regionally percent of the North American samples contained at least one of the five commonly used neonicotinoids that the study measured while only percent of South American ones did Almost half of all samples globally contained more than one type of the pesticides evidence that bees were often foraging in multiple sites affected by pesticides In all the samples the pesticide levels were below what s been established as safe for human exposure Nonconformists could take a page from the proton s playbook The subatomic particle is once again resisting scientists attempts to size it up Everyone agrees the proton is tiny Its radius is less than a femtometer or a trillionth of a millimeter But scientists still don t agree on exactly how small it is A new measurement supports the case for a smaller proton physicist Lothar Maisenbacher and colleagues report in the Oct Science But in some sense it deepens the puzzle says Maisenbacher of the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching Germany The researchers peg the proton s radius at femtometers whereas the textbook value is femtometers That might not seem like a huge difference but the few percent discrepancy is stymieing scientists attempts to test quantum electrodynamics the theory of how electrically charged particles behave In the past scientists gauged the proton s girth in two ways by firing electrons at protons and measuring how the electrons ricocheted or by zapping hydrogen atoms with lasers to study the atoms energy levels which depend on the proton s size Those measurements were all in agreement But in a team of scientists figured out a way to make proton radius measurements much more precise The researchers studied energy levels of muonic hydrogen hydrogen atoms in which the electron is swapped out for a heavier relative called a muon Such measurements found that the proton was about percent smaller than previous estimates or about femtometers SN p Physicists struggled to explain the discrepancy Some suspected that the mismatch could be hinting at undiscovered physics such as a new particle that interacts with muons but not electrons SN p Now by making an improved measurement of energy levels in regular hydrogen Maisenbacher and colleagues find a small proton in close agreement with the muonic hydrogen measurements That suggests that a difference between electrons and muons is probably not the culprit Still the researchers still can t explain why other techniques get different results Electron scattering experiments for example point to a larger proton It s a great result but unfortunately I would say it made it even harder to see what s happening says physicist Jan Bernauer of MIT who was not involved with the new study It remains unclear whether the larger or smaller size is correct Bernauer says The proton puzzle persists DNA of people who lived around years ago reveals an especially lively social scene that may have been a key to humans evolutionary success Much like hunter gatherers today ancient Eurasians married outside their home groups and formed webs of friends and in laws vital for eventually building cities and civilizations a new study suggests Long gone hunter gatherers lived in groups with few close relatives thus limiting opportunities for inbreeding say evolutionary geneticist Martin Sikora of the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen and his colleagues It s likely that adolescents of both sexes found mates in communities other than their own fostering social ties among groups that might otherwise avoid or fight each other the scientists conclude online October in Science Modern hunter gatherers likewise find partners among nearby groups SN p Sikora s findings support a proposal that hunter gatherer bands composed mainly of in laws and unrelated individuals appeared by the late Stone Age and probably much earlier than that says anthropologist Kim Hill of Arizona State University in Tempe who did not participate in the new study The emergence of in laws boosted communication and social learning across groups a prerequisite for creating civilizations Hunter gatherer social structure is apparently unique to humans and is the reason why we alone are so reliant on culture and have achieved the marvels of technology and human society Hill says The new study undercuts a long standing idea that Stone Age hunter gatherers clustered among close kin with men forming alliances and guarding home territories against competing groups much as chimpanzees now do If that s true then the spread of agriculture around years ago may have been what led modern hunter gatherers to develop extensive social networks But Sikora s study shows that modern humans already lived in socially fluid societies well before the origins of agriculture says anthropologist Andrea Migliano of University College London Living in small interacting groups consisting mainly of those who weren t kin made sense for people roaming near arctic parts of Europe and West Asia starting around years ago says paleoanthropologist and study coauthor Marta Miraz n Lahr of the University of Cambridge Those hunter gatherers had to forage over large areas to survive and mate exchanges among groups minimized inbreeding she contends Skeletons of four people buried at a Russian site called Sunghir provided DNA for the new analysis These individuals include a man in his own grave and two preteens or early adolescents placed head to head in the same grave near a piece of an adult s upper leg bone filled with a red pigment Both graves included fancy items such as ivory beads and spears armbands and carvings Researchers have excavated Sunghir intermittently since the s New radiocarbon dates for the human fossils and a mammoth bone found at the site provided a more precise date for the Sunghir burials than was previously available Ancient DNA from the four Sunghir individuals includes parts of the sex chromosomes indicating that all of them were male Scientists had previously suspected that one of the Sunghir youngsters was a girl Genetic comparisons found no signs of close biological kinship No parent grandparent sibling aunt uncle niece or nephew relationships turned up An analysis of a largely complete set of genetic instructions from one Sunghir youngster suggested that he came from a population that split off around years ago from direct ancestors of modern Europeans That ancient Sunghir related population was relatively small with anywhere from about to procreating adults the researchers estimate In rough agreement with previous estimates for present day Europeans and East Asians Sunghir individuals inherited about percent of their DNA from Neandertals Sikora s team finds That interbreeding occurred around years ago the investigators calculate Further cross species flings around years ago contributed nearly another percent Neandertal DNA to the Sunghir group they say Sunghir people did not display genetic markers of inbreeding previously observed in Neandertal DNA SN p Neandertals lacked mating networks like those of ancient humans the researchers propose Space scientists have been intrigued for years with the possibility of finding usable oxygen on the moon not in the lunar atmosphere since there essentially is none but in the rocks As long ago as NASA researchers predicted vast lunar processing plants turning out pounds of liquid oxygen per month both for breathing and as an oxidizer for rocket fuel Now the Surveyor spacecraft reveals it is standing directly over just the kind of rock that would do the job Science News October Update The moon is not yet dotted with lunar oxygen factories but scientists are still devising ways to pull oxygen from moon rocks One technique proposed by NASA scientists in isolates oxygen by heating lunar rocks to over Celsius and exposing them to methane Chemical reactions would produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen which then react to create water Passing an electric current through the water would separate oxygen from hydrogen allowing the desired gas to be captured Raising babies is a combination of the ridiculous the joyful and the difficult And while I am most definitely biased I suspect that there s something even more difficult about raising babies in the Information Age A smartphone can be a powerful tool Information abounds online and some of it is excellent But in the hand of an exhausted worried new parent a smartphone can turn ugly Sometimes parenting information found online is no good even though it seems reputable That s something I learned firsthand after my first daughter was born What I would give to have back the hours I wasted scrolling questionable websites and even more questionable parent forums My struggle to sort good information from bad became the impetus for Growth Curve a blog based on science presenting facts or lack thereof to help parents make the best decisions for their growing families So imagine my delight when I heard from the founders of the new website Parentifact org It describes itself as what happens when two journalists have a baby and it s a breath of fresh air for parents who want solid information quickly Founded by Lee and Elisa Procida two former newspaper reporters Parentifact s goal is to help combat the spread of misinformation about parenting Like my experience the birth of their baby led the Procidas to ask why it s so hard to find clear fact based answers to basic parenting questions They wrote a long piece attempting to answer this question featuring yours truly So now the two parents post well researched and concise answers online to questions such as Should I bank my baby s cord blood and What s normal baby poop color Something I especially like is that the answers come immediately you ll find out right away that medical experts don t usually recommend cord banking and that any color other than red black or white is A OK The website also has a handy internet search tool that pulls from only vetted sources with solid information such as the American Academy of Pediatrics the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and PubMed a gigantic database of published research I m delighted to see this effort and I hope that more websites like this pop up soon Little by little the good information that parents find online may come to outweigh the bad An imaging technique that freezes tiny biological objects such as proteins and viruses in place so that scientists can peer into their structures at the scale of atoms has won its developers the Nobel Prize in chemistry Jacques Dubochet of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland Joachim Frank of Columbia University and Richard Henderson of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge England won for their contributions to the development of the technique called cryo electron microscopy the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October The three will share the million Swedish kronor about million prize Now that we can see the intricate details of every drop of our body fluids we can understand how they are built and how they act and how they work together Sara Snogerup Linse chair of the chemistry Nobel committee said at a news conference We are facing a revolution in biochemistry Soon there are no more secrets Andrew Murray a systems biologist at Harvard University applauded the choice These are people whose work lies at the basis of an incredibly important technique The award he says recognizes people who ve done science for science s sake The ultimate goal is to see molecules up close and personal To map the minute landscape of molecules at scales as tiny as just tenths of a nanometer and help decipher their functions structural biologists have long relied on two tools nuclear magnetic resonance or NMR spectroscopy and X ray crystallography But both techniques have limitations X ray crystallography creates a D picture of a molecule s structure by bouncing X rays off of a crystallized version of a molecule and reconstructing the molecule s structure based on those diffraction patterns But a lot of proteins cannot be crystallized so their structures are inaccessible to the prying mind of the biochemist Murray says NMR meanwhile allows researchers to study biological molecules in a solution such as water but its use has generally been limited to relatively small proteins Enter cryo electron microscopy or cryo EM In the s Henderson first attempted to use regular electron microscopy to study a protein embedded in the membrane of a cell He was unable to crystallize the protein and didn t want to remove it from the membrane and thereby risk altering its structure Electron microscopy wasn t ideal for studying biological molecules This technique works by shining a beam of electrons through a sample and observing how the electrons are deflected by the material they ve passed through The pattern of those deflections sketches out the material s atomic structure But the powerful electron beams can incinerate the material as they pass through it weakening the beam and producing fuzzy images Another drawback The material must be in a vacuum in the microscope and that causes water within biological molecules to evaporate distorting their shapes To get around these problems in Henderson placed bacterial proteins still within their membrane so that they retained their structures within the microscope and covered the membrane with a glucose solution to keep it from drying out He used a weaker electron beam to minimize the damage Because the beam was weaker the images were fuzzier than they would have been with a beam at full strength But since the proteins in his sample happened to be oriented in the same direction Henderson was able to compile the fuzzy images from each protein in the membrane to generate one sharper image He then turned the membrane this way and that capturing the proteins in different orientations and compiling those D images to see the protein s structure in three dimensions The image while an improvement over past efforts wasn t quite at the atomic scale yet that required other advances One such advance came from Frank who was tackling the issue of orientation Unlike Henderson s proteins most proteins in a sample wouldn t all be oriented in the same direction and conveniently ready to compile Frank s solution published in was to create a computer algorithm to scan the images to look for any proteins oriented in the same direction and group them together Like Henderson s compiled image each group in Frank s image would be compiled to create a sharper picture Meanwhile Dubochet was considering the problem of dehydration Henderson s glucose solution wouldn t work for most biomolecules Freezing samples also wouldn t work because ice crystals distort molecules shapes But he realized if the water were to cool extremely rapidly to Celsius in ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen it would solidify without forming ice crystals instead becoming vitreous or glassy In he showed that viruses when covered with a fine layer of vitrified water could be safely studied in the electron microscope That cryo EM technique dovetailed with Henderson s efforts and in Henderson produced the first cryo EM image of a protein at the atomic scale The following year Frank prepared ribosomes cellular structures that help make proteins using the cryo EM method But for some time the resolution of the images remained unsatisfying enough that many researchers called it blobology Over time however other researchers have built on those innovations to improve that resolution with better optics detectors and computational techniques In structural biologist Sriram Subramaniam of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda Md reported improving the resolutionof cryo EM images to an ultrafine nanometer scale finally rivaling the impressive resolution of images produced by X ray crystallography the current gold standard Now we need to apply this to look at larger complexes to understand how these different molecular machines work Subramaniam says Over the last few years cryo EM has begun to demonstrate its potential including revealing the structure of larger and larger objects such as viruses In cryo EM was used to map the structure of the Zika virus SN p helping to identify possible regions to target with a vaccine or antiviral compounds Cryo EM has revolutionized structural biology particularly in the last three years with the invention of new kinds of electron detectors for the microscope says Michael Rossmann a physicist and microbiologist at Purdue University in West Lafayette Ind and a coauthor of the Zika mapping study We call it the resolution revolution Next up he says looking at an entire cell Notes Subramaniam This is just the beginning There are exciting years ahead Jos Dinneny wants us to see plants as stranger things They re able to integrate information and make coherent decisions without a nervous system without a brain he points out Plus plants find water without sight or touch For too many of us however lawns salads and pots on a sunny windowsill make plants so familiar we ve become blind to how exotic they are We re out searching the solar system and the galaxy for extraterrestrial life says Dinneny and we have aliens on our own planet The thrill of discovering plants alien ways drives Dinneny to explore how roots search for water His research group at the Carnegie Institution for Science labs in Stanford Calif runs on curiosity he says His work could have practical food security and geopolitical consequences Dinneny is passionate about the molecular whys and hows of regulating plant growth From a background in basic plant development he moved to questions of environmental stress These questions are important in this huge crisis we face as a species says Jonathan Lynch a root biologist at Penn State and the University of Nottingham in England Knowing how to grow plants in environments degraded by climate change will be crucial to feeding an exploding human population Lynch calls Dinneny one of these transitional characters very important in science He builds bridges between the pure molecular biologists and the more agricultural plant biologists people like me who think about specific plants Lynch says The two groups rarely mingle and focus on different goals and priorities Lynch says He remembers a workshop on plant development and drought stress that Dinneny helped organize People were standing up and shouting To add a touch more agricultural realism to molecular root research Dinneny and colleagues have developed a new alternative to the typical seedlings in petri dishes The system called GLO Roots makes roots in soil easier to watch Plant roots induced to glow spread in slim sandwiches of soil between two clear plates weaving among air pockets micro rivers and clots of dirt Computer analysis of images tracks where root tissues luminesce as various genes turn on in the twinkling underground observatory giving researchers clues to how roots detect and respond to their environment Thrusting out a side branch to seek out water turns out to be a local matter on a root Dinneny and colleagues found using micro CT scans of roots in soil Analyzing hormones showed that the tissues can sense water differences on a scale of mere micrometers The team described the basic development of what Dinneny calls hydropatterning in in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Myself and many other people had studied lateral roots for many years says Malcolm Bennett of the University of Nottingham who collaborated on the study It was familiar to see seedlings forming roots mostly on the wet side But Dinneny thought to ask how something so obvious was actually happening Now he and colleagues are probing deeper into the cellular machinery at work Individual cells in the root need to be expanding to detect water he and Carnegie colleague Neil E Robbins II proposed online in January at bioRxiv org Plants are very different from vertebrates which develop while shielded in wombs or eggs Root branching responds to outside triggers heading toward life sustaining reservoirs In a different world Dinneny says his job might have been cooking plants instead of studying them He can make a mean potpie and enjoys the nightly challenge of preparing a meal that his three children find edible His maternal grandfather s cooking in the s at a resort in Acapulco Mexico impressed a visitor who hired his grandparents as at home cook and maid That meant a move to southern California and eventually a chef position for the grandfather in a Los Angeles restaurant Dinneny spent much of his childhood in California s San Fernando Valley I wasn t tracked to do anything excellent at all he says of his school years I was placed in classes that weren t particularly challenging In th grade though he took an Advanced Placement biology class and still remembers a pivotal moment when his teacher asked about a chemical bond in DNA I was the only person who raised his hand The answer a phosphodiester bond Everyone looked around the room sort of wondering who could possibly have known that factoid he says He was surprised himself and began to realize he had a talent for understanding biology He lobbied hard to transfer to advanced classes and began to apply himself to studying He didn t come from an academic family but he had fine examples of working hard including his single mother a government accountant Often we kind of cubbyhole ourselves into OK I m good at this or I m not good at that Or they re doing well because they re just inherently better at doing this than I am he says There is a magical relationship between effort and success Not every goal gets met but you re going to do better than you ever thought By his senior year Dinneny was a straight A student headed to University of California Berkeley There a holistic approach to plant science captivated him For his Ph D at the University of California San Diego he studied the genetics of plant development then moved to studying plants under environmental stress Deep sea creatures and ocean exploring had captivated him for much of his childhood But plants have turned out to be strange enough Earlier this year General Electric asked a brilliant question What if scientist Mildred Dresselhaus was treated like a celebrity The idea aired as a TV commercial had many of us smiling at the possibility In the ad fans stop the nanoscience pioneer in the street to take selfies a young girl receives a Dresselhaus doll as a birthday gift and a student sends a Millie emoji after acing a physics exam The ad debuted in February during the Academy Awards telecast just weeks before Dresselhaus passed away at age She lived an accomplished life It s nice to know the public got to hear about her even if so late in her life In reality few women or for that matter men in science are well known outside of their own research circles and certainly not well enough to appear on billboards or celebrity talk shows In the spirit of introducing the world to more innovators and doing it early in their careers maybe even in preparation for the next Oscar worthy commercial Science News presents its SN for For the third year we are spotlighting the work of early and mid career scientists age and under who stand out to mentors and peers as people who will make a difference Some of the researchers profiled here nominated by Nobel laureates and recently elected members of the National Academy of Sciences are motivated by the desire to ease the human condition They want to feed the growing world population boost our reliance on renewable energy or reduce the burden of global disease One molecular anthropologist is revisiting the past while an astronomer has his eyes pointed skyward to find habitable worlds outside the solar system These scientists have been called creative curious and fearless They share a willingness to question existing knowledge and forge new paths that is reminiscent of Dresselhaus approach to research Sounds like a winning strategy To choose her research goals Jennifer Dionne envisions conversations with hypothetical grandchildren years down the line What would she want to tell them she had accomplished Then to chart a path to that future I work backward to figure out what are the milestones en route she says That long term vision has led the year old materials scientist on a quest to wrangle light and convince it to do her bidding in interactions with nanoparticles and various materials Already Dionne has created new nanomaterials that steer light in ways that are impossible with natural substances Her new projects could eventually lead to light based technologies used to improve drugs or to create new tests to find cancerous cells There are even applications for renewable energy for example designing materials that help solar cells absorb more light But the route to a scientific vision may not always be clear so Dionne makes time for diversions A lot of the really amazing discoveries that we enjoy today came from just playing in the lab she says Dionne encourages her team to let creativity be a guide melding a serious sense of purpose with play She s a very curious person so she s always learning new things says Paul Alivisatos the vice chancellor for research at the University of California Berkeley who mentored Dionne when she was a postdoc there Plus she s an extremely deep and rigorous thinker Dionne now at Stanford University studies nanophotonics the way that light interacts with matter on very small scales Her interest in light and materials began in childhood she recalls when she was fascinated by the blue morpho butterfly The insect s wings sport an azure hue that comes not from pigments like most colors found in living things but from tiny nanostructures on the wings surface SN p When light reflects off the structures blue wavelengths are amplified while wavelengths corresponding to other colors are canceled out That early interest in tricks of light led Dionne to begin wielding it as a tool during graduate school at Caltech and then her postdoc at UC Berkeley Then and now says Alivisatos she has consistently done very beautiful work At Caltech Dionne and colleagues created a bizarre optical material in which light bends backward As light passes from one material to another say from air to water the rays are deflected due to a property called the index of refraction That s why a straw in a drinking glass appears to be broken at the water s surface In natural materials light always bends in the same direction But that rule gets flipped around in oddball nanomaterials with a negative index of refraction Dionne s material reported in Science in was the first that worked with visible light SN p Because they can steer light around objects to hide the objects from view such materials could be used to create rudimentary versions of invisibility cloaks though so far all attempts are a far cry from Harry Potter s version Dionne is now working on a squid skin with an adjustable refractive index which would mimic the shifting camouflage patterns of the stealthy cephalopod Another focal point of Dionne s research is harnessing light to separate mixtures of mirror image molecules Right and left handed versions of these molecules are perfect reflections of each other like a person s right and left hands The two types are so similar that scientists struggle to separate them which can cause problems for drugmakers In drugs these molecules can be two faced one might relieve pain while the other causes unwanted side effects To separate molecules and their mirror images Dionne is developing techniques that use circularly polarized light in which the light s wiggling electromagnetic waves rotate over time Such light can interact differently with right and left handed molecules for example breaking apart one version while leaving the other unscathed Normally the light s effect is very weak But in a theoretical study published in ACS Photonics last December Dionne and colleagues showed that adding nanoparticles to the mix could enhance the process These tiny particles behave like antennas that concentrate the light onto nearby molecules helping break them apart Dionne is now working to implement the technique She and her colleagues have also created nanoparticles that when illuminated with infrared light emit visible light The color of that light changes depending on how tightly the nanoparticle is squeezed the team reported in Nano Letters in June In keeping with her penchant for creative exploration in the lab Dionne and colleagues fed these nanoparticles to roundworms the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to study the forces exerted as a transparent worm squeezed a meal through its digestive tract You can see the nanoparticles change colors throughout Dionne says She plans to use the technique to reveal more sinister squeezing Cancer cells exert stronger mechanical forces on their environment than healthy cells so such nanoparticles could one day be used to test for cancer she says Dionne is now cooking up other creative ways to use these nanoparticles In collaboration with other researchers she hopes to marshal her color changing nanoparticles to understand how jellyfish move and how plants take a drink Dionne s work exploits light to reveal hidden forces and as a force for good She s done amazing work says materials scientist Prineha Narang of Harvard University Narang was a graduate student at Caltech after Dionne left and had heard chatter about Dionne before meeting her in person The legend of Jen Dionne was definitely all over Narang says So Dionne has made a start at establishing her scientific legacy even before that chat with her future grandchildren A growing band of digital characters that converse read faces and track body language is helping humans to communicate better with one another While virtual helpers that perform practical tasks such as dealing with customer service issues are becoming ubiquitous computer scientist M Ehsan Hoque is at the forefront of a more emotionally savvy movement He and his team at the University of Rochester in New York create software for digital agents that recognize when a person is succeeding or failing in specific types of social interactions Data from face to face conversations and feedback from professional counselors and interviewers with relevant expertise inform this breed of computer advisers One of Hoque s digital helpers grooms people to be better public speakers With words on a screen this attentive app notes for example how many times in a practice talk a person says um gestures inappropriately or awkwardly shifts vocal tone With the help of Google Glass the app even offers useful reminders during actual speeches Another computerized helper this one in the form of an avatar helps people hone their job interviewing skills flagging long winded responses or inconsistent eye contact in practice interviews In the works are computerized conversation coaches that can improve speech and communication skills among people with developmental conditions such as autism and mediate business meetings in ways that encourage everyone to participate in decision making There has been some progress in artificial intelligence but not much in developing emotional aspects of AI Hoque says We re just cracking through the surface at this point The U S Department of Defense and the U S Army have taken notice With their financial support Hoque is developing avatars that collaborate with humans to solve complex problems and digital observers that monitor body language to detect when people are lying This is heady stuff for a year old who earned a doctoral degree just four years ago Hoque who was born in Bangladesh and immigrated to the United States as a teenager did his graduate work with the MIT Media Lab s Affective Computing research group The group s director Rosalind Picard helped launch the field of affective computing in the s which focuses on the study and development of computers and robots that recognize interpret and simulate human emotions Hoque s approach puts a service spin on affective computing As a grad student he developed software he dubbed MACH short for My Automated Conversation coacH This system simulates face to face conversations with a computer generated D man or woman that sees hears and makes decisions while conversing with a real life partner Digital analyses of a human partner s speech and nonverbal behavior inform the avatar s responses during a session A simulated coach may for instance let a user know if smiles during an interview look forced or are mistimed After a session users see a video of the interaction accompanied by displays of how well or poorly they did on various interaction skills such as keeping eye contact and nodding at appropriate times MACH got its start in trials that trained MIT undergraduates how to conduct themselves during interviews with career counselors First Hoque analyzed smiles and other behaviors that either helped or hurt the impressions job candidates left on experienced counselors in mock interviews In a series of follow up studies his team developed an automated system that recognized impression enhancing behaviors during simulated interviews That pilot version of MACH was then put to the test Women but not men who received MACH training and got feedback from their digital coach while watching videos of their initial interviews with a counselor displayed substantial improvement in follow up interviews MACH trainees who watched interview videos but got no feedback showed minimal improvement Testing with larger groups of men and women is under way As he developed MACH Hoque consulted MIT sociologist and clinical psychologist Sherry Turkle That was a bold move since Turkle has warned for years that despite its pluses digital culture discourages person to person connections Social robots in particular represent a way for people to escape the challenges of forging authentic relationships Turkle contends But she came away impressed with Hoque whose goals she calls refreshingly modest and transparent His avatars will be helpers and facilitators she says not companions friends therapists and pretend people Hoque s approach grew out of personal experience He is the primary caregiver for his year old brother Eshteher who has Down syndrome and does not speak Eshteher can make sounds to refer to certain things such as food and has limited use of sign language I ve spent a lot of time with him and can read what he s experiencing like when he s frustrated or repentant Hoque says So it s not surprising that Hoque s next generation MACH dubbed LISSA for Live Interactive Social Skill Assistance is an avatar that conducts flexible getting acquainted conversations while providing feedback on users eye contact speaking volume smiling and body movements via flashing icons LISSA has shown promise in preliminary tests aimed at improving the conversational chops of college students attending speed dating sessions and individuals with autism spectrum disorders Hoque plans to expand this technology for use with people suffering from social phobia and post traumatic stress disorder He s also working on an avatar that trains doctors to communicate clearly and compassionately with patients being treated for life threatening cancers Hoque s work on emotionally perceptive avatars may eventually transform the young industry of digital assistants currently limited to voices in a box such as Apple s Siri and Microsoft s Cortana says cognitive scientist Mary Czerwinski a principal researcher at Microsoft Research Lab in Redmond Wash Avatar research could lead to more natural personable digital assistants Czerwinski predicts Hoque agrees In the future we ll all have digital personalized assistants he says If he gets his way emotionally attuned helpers will make us more social and less isolated That s something to applaud if we can manage to put down our smartphones Physicists often ponder small things but probably not the ones on Kerwyn Casey KC Huang s mind He wants to know what it s like to be a bacterium My motivating questions are about understanding the physical challenges bacterial cells face he says Bacteria are the dominant life forms on Earth They affect the health of plants and animals including humans for good and bad Yet scientists know very little about the rules the microbes live by Even questions as basic as how bacteria determine their shape are still up in the air says Huang of Stanford University Huang is out to change that He and colleagues have determined what gives cholera bacteria their curved shape and whether it matters a polymer protein and it does matter the curve makes it easier for cholera to cause disease how different wavelengths of light affect movement of photosynthetic bacteria red and green wavelengths encourage movement blue light stops the microbes in their tracks how bacteria coordinate cell division machinery and how photosynthetic bacteria s growth changes in light and dark All four of these findings and more were published in just the first three months of this year Huang also looks for ways to use tools and techniques his team develops to solve problems unrelated to bacteria Computer programs that measure changes in bacterial cell shape can also track cells in plant roots and in developing zebrafish embryos He s even helped determine how a protein s activity and stability contribute to a human genetic disease A physicist by training Huang delves into biology biochemistry microbial ecology genetics engineering computer science and more partnering with a variety of scientists from across those fields He s even teamed up with his statistician sister He s an all in one scientist says longtime collaborator Ned Wingreen a biophysicist at Princeton University When Huang started his lab at Stanford in after getting his Ph D at MIT and spending time at Princeton as a postdoctoral fellow his background was purely theoretical He designed and ran the computer simulations and then his collaborators carried out the experiments But soon he wanted to do hands on research too to learn why cells are the way they are Such a leap is not trivial says Christine Jacobs Wagner a microbiologist at Yale University who also studies bacterial cell shape But Huang is a really really good experimentalist she says Jacobs Wagner was particularly impressed with a brilliant microfluidics experiment Huang did to test a well established truism about how bacteria grow Researchers used to think that turgor pressure water pressure inside a cell that pushes the outer membrane against the cell wall controlled bacterial growth just like it does in plants But abolishing turgor pressure didn t change E coli s growth rate Huang and colleagues reported in in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences This result blew my mind away Jacobs Wagner says The finding crumbled the foundation of what scientists thought about bacterial growth He uses clever experiments to challenge old paradigms Jacobs Wagner says More than once he has come up with a new trick to address a tough question Sometimes Huang s tricks require breaking things Zemer Gitai a microbiologist at Princeton remembers talking with Huang and Wingreen about a question that microbiologists were stuck on How are molecules oriented in bacterial cell walls Researchers knew that the walls are made of rigid sugar strands connected by flexible proteins like a chain link fence held together by rubber bands What they didn t know was whether the rubber bands circled the bacteria like the hoops on a wine barrel ran in stripes down the length of the cell or stuck out like hairs If bacteria were put under pressure the cells would crack along the weak rubber band like links Huang and Wingreen reasoned If the cells split like hot dogs on a grill it would mean the links ran the length of the cells If they opened like a Slinky it would suggest a wine barrel configuration The researchers reported the results opened like a Slinky in Another group using improved microscope techniques got the same result Huang teamed up with other researchers to do microfluidics experiments growing bacteria in tiny chambers and tracking individual cells to learn how photosynthetic bacteria grow in light and dark But in nature bacteria don t live alone So Huang has also worked with Stanford colleague Justin Sonnenburg to answer a basic question Where and when are bacteria in the gut growing No one knows Huang says How can we not know that It s totally fundamental Without that information it s impossible to know for example how antibiotics affect the microbial community in the intestines he says Stripping fiber from a mouse s diet not only changes the mix of microbes in the gut it alters where in the intestines the microbes grow the researchers discovered Bacteria deprived of fiber s complex sugars began to munch on the protective mucus lining the intestines bumping against the intestinal lining and sparking inflammation Huang Sonnenburg and colleagues reported in Cell Host Microbe in Huang s breadth of research from deciphering the nanoscale twists of proteins to mapping whole microbial communities is sure to lead to many more discoveries He s capable of making contributions to any field Jacobs Wagner says or any research question that he s interested in By early next spring astronomer David Kipping hopes to know if the object he s spent his early career searching for is really there An astronomer at Columbia University Kipping is perhaps most known for a project sifting through data from the Kepler space telescope on more than a thousand planets orbiting distant stars But he s more interested in their moons A moon could be a home to alien life even if its planet is inhospitable SN p A moon could also make its host planet more likely to harbor life Some models suggest that the presence of our moon might have helped make Earth a nice place to live The same could be true for other moon planet partnerships So Kipping s search dubbed the Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler gets at the fundamental nature of our place in the universe Are we alone In late October Kipping and colleagues will use the Hubble Space Telescope to find out if they ve caught their first quarry The possible candidate is a Neptune sized object orbiting the planet Kepler b SN p If the candidate turns out to be a genuine exomoon Kipping is quick to point out that similar hints have fizzled before he will no doubt solidify his reputation as the moon guy But he dabbles in a lot of things I write a lot of failed papers he admits He arrived at exomoons by following a simple philosophy No idea is too crazy His signature projects are quite risky but with obvious large payback says Dimitar Sasselov director of the Harvard Origins of Life Initiative who worked with Kipping in his postdoc research at Harvard University Kipping now grew up in a small town in England He loved Star Trek wanted to be an astronaut and memorized the names and masses of all the planets in the solar system and their moons Supportive teachers encouraged him to pursue a career in physics at a time when exoplanet research was just starting to be taken seriously By when he was an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge there were a few dozen known exoplanets But there are billion stars in the Milky Way It felt like there was a huge wave of discovery waiting to happen Kipping says Six years later NASA launched Kepler and within five years the number of known exoplanets ballooned to well over All the planets Kepler has picked up made themselves known by blocking their star s light as they crossed or transited in front of the star Those transits produce a characteristic U shape in graphs of starlight over time As a graduate student at University College London Kipping considered what the U shaped graphs might reveal about the planets Researchers already knew that deeper U s mean larger planets for example More frequent U s mean shorter orbital periods While staring at the stars on a hiking trip in the Himalayas Kipping thought of something else that could change the U It was just obvious to me that a moon could screw it up he says A large enough moon would create an occasional extra dip in the light In the early days of the exoplanet boom actually looking for such dips in the Kepler data was an audacious notion But Kipping jumped in anyway I assumed it would be a tiny effect but it turned out to be detectable Kipping says His paper published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in pointed out that Kepler could be used to search for exomoons too To pursue the search in earnest Kipping taught himself new data processing techniques The problem proved so computationally intensive that he turned to crowdfunding to buy a supercomputer while a postdoc at Harvard His hunt caught on in the popular press with write ups in Time magazine and Wired And other scientists joined the chase as well with several more groups announcing competing searches in the past few years There s a reason Kipping s team has found only one exomoon candidate so far There aren t many out there big enough for Kepler to see according to his statistical work Because he s doing such a careful job it probably means something Sasselov adds The systems the team has checked that show no moons most likely aren t hiding any As a new faculty member at Columbia Kipping has lately turned his attention to teaching mentoring and outreach Many of his students say he supports their wildest pursuits even those outside astronomy like machine learning or linguistics He s known for out there ideas says current graduate student Moiya McTier who first worked with Kipping as an undergrad student in the Banneker Institute at Harvard a program to prepare students of color for careers in astronomy Which is great because I don t feel afraid of going to him with my own crazy ideas Kipping s latest experiment is a YouTube channel aimed at nonscientists Outreach isn t really rewarded in the academic world he says It s a thing I wouldn t have done as a postdoc but felt it was a risk I was willing to take as a faculty member It has paid unexpected scientific dividends already While preparing a video about the Breakthrough Starshot initiative which aims to send tiny spacecraft at percent the speed of light to visit the nearest star to the sun SN p Kipping realized there was an error in the Breakthrough team s calculations of the photon pressure needed to propel the craft The error connected back to Albert Einstein s paper about special relativity and came from some assumptions made for simplicity that wouldn t hold in real life Kipping s paper discussing the error was published in June in the Astronomical Journal I would never have written a paper about special relativity if I hadn t been doing outreach about Starshot he says His philosophy makes more sense every year Let all the crazy in You never know where it will lead For Chong Liu asking a scientific question is something like placing a bet You throw all your energy into tackling a big and challenging problem with no guarantee of a reward As a student he bet that he could create a contraption that photosynthesizes like a leaf on a tree but better For the now year old chemist the gamble is paying off He opened up a new field says Peidong Yang a chemist at the University of California Berkeley who was Liu s Ph D adviser Liu was among the first to combine bacteria with metals or other inorganic materials to replicate the energy generating chemical reactions of photosynthesis Yang says Liu s approach to artificial photosynthesis may one day be especially useful in places without extensive energy infrastructure Liu first became interested in chemistry during high school and majored in the subject at Fudan University in Shanghai He recalls feeling frustrated in school when he would ask questions and be told that the answer was beyond the scope of what he needed to know Research was a chance to seek out answers on his own And the problem of artificial photosynthesis seemed like something substantial to throw himself into challenging enough so I wouldn t be jobless in or years he jokes Photosynthesis is a simple but powerful process Sunlight helps transform carbon dioxide and water into chemical energy stored in the chemical bonds of sugar molecules But in nature the process isn t particularly efficient converting just percent of solar energy into chemical energy Liu thought he could do better with a hybrid system The efficiency of natural photosynthesis is limited by light absorbing pigments in plants or bacteria he says People have designed materials that absorb light far more efficiently But when it comes to transforming that light energy into fuel bacteria shine By taking a hybrid approach you leverage what each side is better at says Dick Co managing director of the Solar Fuels Institute at Northwestern University in Evanston Ill Liu s early inspiration was an Apollo era attempt at a life support system for manned space missions The idea was to use inorganic materials with specialized bacteria to turn astronauts exhaled carbon dioxide into food But early attempts never went anywhere The efficiency was terribly low way worse than you d expect from plants Liu says And the bacteria kept dying probably because other parts of the system were producing molecules that were toxic to the bacteria As a graduate student Liu decided to use his understanding of inorganic chemistry to build a system that would work alongside the bacteria not against them He first designed a system that uses nanowires coated with bacteria The nanowires collect sunlight much like the light absorbing layer on a solar panel and the bacteria use the energy from that sunlight to carry out chemical reactions that turn carbon dioxide into a liquid fuel such as isopropanol As a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Harvard University chemist Daniel Nocera Liu collaborated on a different approach Nocera had been working on a bionic leaf in which solar panels provide the energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gases Then Ralstonia eutropha bacteria consume the hydrogen gas and pull in carbon dioxide from the air The microbes are genetically engineered to transform the ingredients into isopropanol or another liquid fuel But the project faced many of the same problems as other bacteria based artificial photosynthesis attempts low efficiency and lots of dead bacteria Chong figured out how to make the system extremely efficient Nocera says He invented biocompatible catalysts that jump start the chemical reactions inside the system without killing off the fuel generating bacteria That advance required sifting through countless scientific papers for clues to how different materials might interact with the bacteria and then testing many different options in the lab In the end Liu replaced the original system s problem catalysts which made a microbe killing highly reactive type of oxygen molecule with cobalt phosphorus which didn t bother the bacteria Chong is very skilled and open minded Nocera says His ability to integrate different fields was a big asset The team published the results in Science in reporting that the device was about times as efficient as plants at removing carbon dioxide from the air With kilowatt hour of energy powering the system Liu calculated it could recycle all the carbon dioxide in more than liters of air into other molecules that could be turned into fuel Using different bacteria but the same overall setup the researchers later turned nitrogen gas into ammonia for fertilizer which could offer a more sustainable approach to the energy guzzling method used for fertilizer production today Soil bacteria carry out similar reactions turning atmospheric nitrogen into forms that are usable by plants Now at UCLA Liu is launching his own lab to study the way the inorganic components of soil influence bacteria s ability to run these and other important chemical reactions He wants to understand the relationship between soil and microbes not as crazy a leap as it seems he says The stuff you might dig out of your garden is like his approach to artificial photosynthesis inorganic materials plus biological stuff he says It s a mixture Liu is ready to place a new bet this time on re creating the reactions in soil the same way he s mimicked the reactions in a leaf Here are some of the things Kay Tye relishes break dancing rock climbing snowboarding poker raising her young daughter and son These adrenaline fueled activities all require basic skills But true mastery and the joy Tye finds in them comes from improvisation She boldly steps into a void a realm where she has to riff and trusts that a flash of insight will lead the way out As a year old neuroscientist studying how the brain creates experiences Tye brings this mix of fearlessness and creativity to her lab where it s a key ingredient to her success Kay always finds this interesting twist says Leslie Vosshall a molecular neurobiologist at Rockefeller University in New York City Tye s group at MIT investigates scientific questions in innovative ways often with powerful results The goal Tye says is ambitious to identify in neuroscientific terms the core of what makes us individuals We all live in the same world but have vastly different experiences of it Our private emotions and motivations are crucial for driving our behavior But just how our inner mental lives are created she says is a mystery How do we actually ground the mind in the brain So far Tye s findings which come in large part from tweaking nerve cells and behaviors in lab animals have led to a deeper understanding of the intricate neural forces that shape experiences Many of those forces may operate similarly in people she believes One insight came unexpectedly After a series of experiments on how certain nerve cells respond to cocaine the data were in shambles But Tye and postdoctoral researcher Gillian Matthews didn t shy from the project Instead they ventured into the void hunting for inventive ways to explain the puzzling results It turns out that these nerve cells buried in a part of the mouse brain called the dorsal raphe nucleus weren t responding to cocaine at all They were reacting to a mouse version of loneliness In the course of the experiments some of the mice were isolated In mice reintroduced to companions after a period of solitude dorsal raphe nerve cells grew very active Tye and colleagues reported in in Cell Using a technique called optogenetics developed in Karl Deisseroth s lab at Stanford where Tye was a postdoc the researchers turned these same cells on artificially with a laser Though the mice didn t seem to like the sensation avoiding a place where the stimulation happened the artificial kick made the mice more social Tye suspects that these cells play a role in creating a sensation similar to loneliness or alleviating it by promoting social interactions The results in mice offer a handhold to explore how these nerve cells might work together to create the mind We threw away what we originally thought completely Tye says The word cocaine doesn t appear in the paper It was really fun to go on that journey with Matthews because where we ended up was not where we thought we were going to go In another experiment using optogenetics Tye and colleagues pitted the sensations of reward and punishment against each other in rats Published in the June Nature Neuroscience the results describe the neural pathways that help an animal decide whether to risk a shock for a sweet treat Looking at reward and punishment simultaneously in this way is not something other researchers had done These insights into motivated behaviors come from blending state of the art techniques with clever experimental design says neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux of New York University The question of how the brain decides on a behavior is a classic one and Tye is taking it to a new level of neurobiological sophistication he says But she s not doing it alone At MIT where Tye also did her undergraduate work before going to the University of California San Francisco for a Ph D she heads a research lab full of people Vosshall describes as fiercely loyal and incredibly hardworking Helping her graduate students find their scientific footing is one of Tye s favorite parts of the job a task she likens to the dynamic role of being a mother to young children It takes my breath away quite frequently Tye says to see someone blossom and grow and develop and get stronger and get more capable and more confident The joy Tye finds in nurturing her science tribe is obvious and no doubt provides opportunities to go off script In science and in her personal life she delights in the unexpected an inclination evident from her poker game Some poker players grind it out playing a very careful tight game she says That s not the way I enjoy playing The hands I like being in the most are where anything can happen Lena Pernas love of parasites began in childhood when she was plagued with many virtual infections One of her favorite pastimes as a year old was playing The Amazon Trail an educational computer game set near the South American river One of the dangers players could encounter was malaria and I got malaria a lot Pernas says This predicament inspired her to learn about the disease caused by Plasmodium parasites Since then she s taken every opportunity to study parasites It s been a singular obsession she says Her parasite of choice eventually became Toxoplasma gondii which is estimated to infect one third of humans Toxoplasma has an unparalleled mammalian host range Pernas says It is able to infect basically any warm blooded animal The parasite causes toxoplasmosis not a terribly bothersome disease for people with a healthy immune system But the disease can be serious damaging the eyes and brain in those with weakened immune systems and in fetuses Pregnant women are warned not to handle kitty litter because the parasite can be found in cat feces Pernas now age and a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Padova in Italy has upended previous thinking about how this parasite interacts with its host specifically its interplay with mitochondria Known as the cell s energy producers mitochondria also take part in activities related to immunity and cell death By studying how mitochondria respond to a parasitic infection Pernas has begun to probe the ways access to nutrients in the cell which both the cell and the parasite need shapes an infection Studying the vying for nutrients in the cell will teach us really interesting biology about how the cell senses the presence of a parasite metabolically and how the cell is able to metabolically respond Pernas says knowledge that could lead to new therapies Her discoveries are at the forefront of a new focus in microbiology viewing the host pathogen relationship as a competition for nutrients says cell biologist Navdeep Chandel of Northwestern University in Chicago When Toxoplasma infects a mammalian cell it uses part of the cell s membrane to wrap itself in a little sac called a vacuole Early imaging showed a ring of the host cell s mitochondria surrounding the parasite s vacuole But why the mitochondria were there wasn t clear As a graduate student in the lab of microbiologist John Boothroyd of Stanford University School of Medicine Pernas questioned two existing assumptions that all three main strains of Toxoplasma interact with mitochondria in the same way and that the key protein underpinning this relationship had already been found She was right to ask In in PLOS Biology Pernas Boothroyd and colleagues reported that when a type I or type III Toxoplasma parasite invades a cell the mitochondria circle the vacuole But when the type II parasite enters the mitochondria don t gather around With this knowledge Pernas and colleagues identified the correct parasitic protein that tethers the organelles to the vacuole The three Toxoplasma types have the gene for this protein called MAF but only type I and III make the protein the researchers found Pernas completely countered the dogma of the field Boothroyd says Where she excels is having that instinct of saying This one doesn t smell right The discovery of the protein as well as the difference between strains is important Boothroyd adds It indicates that the interaction with mitochondria is driven by Toxoplasma rather than the host cell and it is likely something the parasite does to enable survival in some particular subset of hosts he says Pernas postdoctoral work is beginning to uncover how the interaction between the organelles and the parasite affect the invader s survival She s investigating what she calls the rules that govern the hunger games between the host and parasite To survive Toxoplasma needs nutrients from its host cell The parasite is a prolific scavenger of fatty acids Pernas explains Mitochondria also take up fatty acids breaking them down for energy When a type I or III Toxoplasma parasite infects a cell the mitochondria somehow sense the parasite s presence and move to surround the vacuole Pernas says Why this doesn t happen with type II parasites is unclear What comes next is a fight for fatty acids she says She has found in unpublished work that the invading parasite starts gobbling up fatty acids The mitochondria circling the vacuole actually fuse together allowing them to efficiently use nutrients This limits the fatty acids that the parasite can get The parasite sends out the MAF protein to tether the mitochondria to the vacuole which may be what breaks them apart giving the parasite the greater share of fatty acids This fight between host and pathogen for nutrients might be a widespread phenomenon Chandel says A better understanding of the battle could lead to new therapies that control an infection by keeping parasites from getting to the cell s nutrients Pernas says She d also like to study how malnutrition might change the course of an infection My dream would be to take the biological research to the global level she says and figure out how different states of nutrition might affect the human response and the mammalian response to infection In a pitch black rainforest with fluttering moths and crawling centipedes Christina Warinner dug up her first skeleton Well technically it was a full skeleton plus two headless ones all seated and draped in ornate jewelry To deter looters she excavated through the night while one teammate held up a light and another killed as many bugs as possible As Warinner worked unanswerable questions about the people whose skeletons she was excavating flew through her mind There s only so much you can learn by looking with your own eyes at a skeleton she says I became increasingly interested in all the things that I could not see all the stories that these skeletons had to tell that weren t immediately accessible but could be accessible through science At age Warinner cut her teeth on that incredibly complex sacrificial burial left behind by the Maya in a Belize rainforest Today at age the molecular anthropologist scrapes at not so pearly whites to investigate similar questions splitting her time between the University of Oklahoma in Norman and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena Germany In she and colleagues reported a finding that generated enough buzz to renew interest in an archaeological resource many had written off decades ago fossilized dental plaque or calculus Ancient DNA and proteins in the plaque belong to microbes that could spill the secrets of the humans they once inhabited what the people ate what ailed them perhaps even what they did for a living Bacteria form plaque that mineralizes into calculus throughout a person s life It s the only part of your body that fossilizes while you re still alive notes Warinner It s also the last thing to decay Though plaque is prolific in the archaeological record most researchers viewed calculus as the crap you scraped off your tooth in order to study it says Amanda Henry an archaeologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands With some exceptions molecular biologists saw calculus as a shoddy source of ancient DNA But a few researchers including Henry had been looking at calculus for remnants of foods as potential clues to ancient diets Inspired by some of Henry s images of starch grains preserved in calculus Warinner wondered if the plaque might yield dead bacterial structures perhaps even bacteria s genetic blueprints Her timing couldn t have been better Warinner began her graduate studies at Harvard in just after the sequencing of the human genome was completed and by the time she left in efforts to survey the human microbiome were in full swing As a postdoc at the University of Zurich Warinner decided to attempt to extract DNA from the underappreciated dental grime preserved on the teeth of four medieval skeletons from Germany At first the results were dismal But she kept at it Tina has a very interested curious and driven personality Henry notes Warinner turned to a new instrument that could measure DNA concentrations in skimpy samples a Qubit fluorometer A surprising error message appeared DNA too high Dental calculus it turned out was chock full of genetic material While people were struggling to pull out human DNA from the skeleton itself there s to times more DNA in the calculus Warinner says It was sitting there in almost every skeletal collection untouched unanalyzed To help her interpret the data Warinner mustered an army of collaborators from fields ranging from immunology to metagenomics She and her colleagues found a slew of proteins and DNA snippets from bacteria viruses and fungi including dozens of oral pathogens as well as the full genetic blueprint of an ancient strain of Tannerella forsythia which still infects people s gums today In Warinner s team revealed a detailed map of a miniature microbial world on the decaying teeth of those German skeletons in Nature Genetics Later in her group found the first direct protein based evidence of milk consumption in the plaque of Bronze Age skeletons from B C That same study linked milk proteins preserved in the calculus of other ancient human skeletons to specific animals providing a peek into long ago lifestyles The fact that you can tell the difference between say goat milk and cow milk that s kind of mind blowing says Laura Weyrich a microbiologist at the University of Adelaide in Australia who also studies calculus Since then Warinner has found all sorts of odds and ends lurking on archaic chompers from poppy seeds to paint pigments Warinner s team is still looking at the origins of dairying and its microbial players but she s also branching out to the other end of the digestive spectrum The researchers are looking at ancient DNA in paleofeces which is exactly what it sounds like desiccated or semifossilized poop It doesn t stay as fresh as plaque in the archaeological record But she s managed to find some sites with well preserved samples By examining the array of microbes that lived in the excrement and plaque of past humans and their relatives Warinner hopes to characterize how our microbial communities have changed through time and how they ve changed us The research has implications for understanding chronic complex human diseases over time Warinner s ancient DNA work opens up a window on past health says Clark Larsen an anthropologist at Ohio State University It s all part of what Warinner calls the archaeology of the unseen Biologist Luhan Yang dreams of pig organs that will one day fly into people If she has her way animal farms will raise herds of bioengineered pigs designed to produce kidneys livers and other organs that could be transplanted into humans Animal parts would slip seamlessly into people easing their suffering There are millions of patients worldwide waiting for organ transplants says Yang who is chief scientific officer of eGenesis a biotech start up in Cambridge Mass It s such a huge unmet need Researchers have long dreamed of using animal organs to alleviate the shortage of human ones a field called xenotransplantation So far those efforts have ended in failure usually with the person s immune system rejecting the transplanted animal organ But Yang has both the tools and the drive to change that She is pioneering the direct editing of mammals genetic instruction books or genomes working to tweak DNA to make pig organs more acceptable inside humans All before her nd birthday Luhan is exceptionally bold yet careful says George Church a biologist at Harvard University who oversaw Yang s Ph D work and then cofounded eGenesis with her She is unstoppable Yang grew up in Sichuan province in southwestern China at the base of a mountain that inspired a fascination with nature In high school she developed biology skills thanks in part to a teacher who took classes into the woods to learn about plants and animals She passed a rigorous set of exams and was chosen for China s team for the International Biology Olympiad where she won a gold medal in At Peking University in Beijing she studied not only life science but also added a second major psychology The human brain and thinking are the most mysterious part to me she says That background later served her well in navigating the fast paced management of biotech start ups In Yang moved to the United States to explore options for her Ph D work Intrigued by the medical applications of basic research she rotated through laboratories in cardiology and cardiovascular disease before settling on Church s group She says its innovative approach to genome engineering was a better match for her desire to look at biological problems holistically This was after all the lab that tasked itself to engineer an embryo of a woolly mammoth Language difficulties nearly derailed Yang at first But she persevered to improve her English while beginning to rack up achievements New methods of genome engineering were popping up regularly and she knew she could either work on techniques that already existed and churn out publications or dive in and work on risky projects with a potentially greater payoff We didn t try to ride a trend she says We tried to pioneer a field The gamble worked thanks to the game changing CRISPR Cas gene editing technique that was just beginning to take off With CRISPR biologists could precisely and permanently modify genes in living organisms Yang dove right in to push the technology in new directions In in the journal Science a team led by her and bioengineer Prashant Mali now at the University of California San Diego stunned the scientific world by reporting CRISPR gene editing in human stem cells And in Yang reported figuring out a way around one of the biggest problems in pig organ transplants Pig cells contain retroviruses that may infect human cells when transplanted In a paper in Science Yang Church and others described a method using CRISPR in cell lines to eliminate retrovirus genes from pigs at once SN p It was the most genetic modifications anyone had ever made to a mammalian genome and opened the door to new ways of circumventing rejection problems with pig organs With her Ph D in hand Yang cofounded eGenesis Her next goal is to create what she calls Pig which will be not only free of the harmful retroviruses but also incorporate additional genetic tweaks to get around immune rejection In August the team reported another step toward that goal The researchers had raised not just cell lines that were free of the retroviruses but live piglets in which problematic retroviruses had been eliminated SN p This will be an important foundation for building a better pig for transplantation says Philip O Connell a transplant specialist at the University of Sydney in Westmead Australia They have made the prospect of xenotransplantation a lot safer The next step is to see how long the pigs live and what long term effect the gene editing has on them is a very important year for eGenesis Yang says After years in academia Yang likes being in the stimulating biotech culture of Kendall Square where at a restaurant lunch she can hear people brainstorming innovative ways to tackle disease She continues to work on ambitious side projects such as with Church and others an effort to synthesize human genomes from scratch In her limited spare time she plays badminton runs and hikes but most of all she reads Each year she chooses a theme for her books One year it was Western art history and another it was detective novels For she is focusing on books about leadership to better handle the management decisions that come with heading a driven person team She recommends True North from Bill George a former Medtronic CEO for tips on how to be an inspiring leader For Yang there is no slowing down at the top We strive to create a world where there is no organ shortage she says We understand it is a very audacious vision We get up every day to work on that Like anything else in life there is a lot of luck in scientific success Astronomers searching for new worlds have to pick the right sections of sky Biologists cross their fingers that their cell lines will survive long enough for an experiment Two paleontologists are excavating at a field site in Montana both skilled both committed One turns up a T rex skeleton the other nothing but dirt In the end it s the luck of the dig A fruitful career in science can also depend on the luck of birth Early exposure to the wonders of discovery access to a good education and the wisdom of an academic mentor are all matters often outside of a future scientist s control As is the historical context in which a scientist lives It s impossible to know but what if Albert Einstein had been born a century earlier or a century later Would his mind brilliant as it was still have been suited to solve the puzzles of the day Would his insights have been ignored Or would his ideas have arrived too late with someone else making his biggest discoveries More than one Nobel laureate has credited success at least in part to being in the right place at the right time In the s two sociologists explored the idea of the right time by asking the question Are inventions inevitable William Ogburn of Columbia University and his student Dorothy Thomas studied the phenomenon of simultaneous discovery the fact that multiple people often hit on the same idea at the same time The duo compiled a list of inventions and discoveries made independently by two or more persons Included were the discovery of Neptune s the branch of mathematics known as calculus s and the function of the pancreas s Ogburn and Thomas went on to ask a number of lofty questions including Are inventions independent of mental ability My answer Most definitely not Yes advances are often a product of their times One step forward requires previous steps the bubbling and building of data and ideas even Isaac Newton stood on the shoulders of giants But the individual is absolutely essential It s the individual brain often in collaboration with other individual brains that takes the work that has come before and figures out how to add to it It s that unique contribution that makes for scientific progress Such progress might come from a spark of insight a moment of creativity or a steady pound pounding on a problem It might come from the drive required to go big say by putting tubs of ultrapure water at the foot of the Andes to detect cosmic rays Individuals have to take some initiative to do something great with what they ve got Often the most game changing discoveries come from the boldness to imagine that existing paradigms might be wrong That s a theme repeated in this special issue For the third year Science News is spotlighting early and mid career scientists who are through their own special mixes of personal attributes leaving a mark on their fields It s a rare for us celebration of the individual And it demonstrates that luck is not enough Not nearly Pluto has no rings New Horizons triple checked An exhaustive search for rings and dust particles around the dwarf planet before during and after the spacecraft flew past Pluto in has come up empty It s a very long paper to say we didn t find anything says team member Tod Lauer of the analysis posted online September at arXiv org But the nonresult could help scientists understand the contents of the outer solar system and help plan New Horizons next encounter The spacecraft is now on a course to a space rock in the Kuiper Belt another billion kilometers past Pluto Before New Horizons arrived at Pluto the possible existence of rings was an urgent matter of safety Hitting a particle as small as a sand grain could have damaged the spacecraft Searches with the Hubble Space Telescope in and turned up two previously unknown moonsorbiting Pluto Kerberos and Styx SN p and zero rings Even so many researchers expected to encounter rings or at least some debris The four outer planets in the solar system have rings as do other small bodies in the solar system like the tiny planetoid Chariklo SN p And some studies suggest that Pluto probably had rings at one point in its past left over from the collision that formed its largest moon Charon Nine weeks before New Horizons closest approach to Pluto a team jokingly called the crow s nest acted much like a ship s lookout for potential hazards says Lauer an astronomer with the National Optical Astronomy Observatory in Tucson Ariz The group examined images taken with the spacecraft s Long Range Reconnaissance Imager camera looking for ring particles reflecting sunlight or spots that moved against a starry background from one set of images to the next Nothing turned up The team declared the spacecraft s trajectory safe and New Horizons flew sailed safely past Pluto on July SN Online After the flyby the team turned New Horizons around to look back at Pluto and towards the sun This was a much better position to look for rings as dust particles would pop into view when backlit by the sun like motes of dust in the light from a window If you really want to know for sure whether there s any dust there the viewing geometries where you re looking past the dust with the sun in the background that s the gold standard says Matthew Tiscareno of the SETI Institute in Mountain View Calif who studied Saturn s rings with the Cassini spacecraft but was not involved in New Horizons It took the better part of a year for all the data from New Horizons to return to Earth and several months after that to analyze it but the team is now ready to call it The rings really aren t there or at least they re too diffuse to see That s somewhat surprising Lauer says But the chaotic gravity of Pluto s family of moons might make it too hard for rings to find stable orbits Or the slight pressure generated by light particles streaming from the sun could constantly blow would be ring particles away It s also possible there just wasn t that much dust there to begin with New Horizons saw fewer craters on Pluto and Charon than expected which could mean there are fewer small bodies at that distance from the sun smacking into Pluto and its moons and kicking up dust That could be good news for New Horizons next act After five months in hibernation the spacecraft woke up on September and has set its sights on a smaller weirder and more distant object a space rock about kilometers long called MU SN Online Initial observations suggest it might be a double object with two bodies orbiting closely or touching lightly New Horizons will fly past MU on January In the meantime the team is looking for hazards along the route We re going to do a similar effort to what we did with Pluto Lauer says We re going to get in the crow s nest and get out our binoculars as it were and see if we re going to be okay An imaging technique that lets scientists capture D views of proteins viruses and other molecules at the atomic scale has won its developers the Nobel Prize in chemistry Jacques Dubochet of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland Joachim Frank of Columbia University and Richard Henderson of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge will share the prize the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October Called cryo electron microscopy the imaging technique freezes biological molecules in place and reveals their inner workings Applying electron microscopy to biology was a challenge because the technique is done in a vacuum which can dry out and distort the shape of proteins and other biological molecules Historically this kind of microscopy was used to look at nonliving things After working on the problem for years in Henderson captured the first D image of a protein using an electron microscope Frank developed a way to combine blurry D images into a sharp D picture which made the technique more useful for looking at complex proteins And Dubochet discovered how to freeze water around molecules so rapidly that it couldn t create crystals that would disrupt the electron beams and distort the images Since then the technique has been honed even further improving its resolution It s been used to capture up close pictures of the Zika virus to examine the inner workings of circadian clocks and more Contrary to popular opinion humans didn t shed a harsh existence as hunter gatherers and herders for the good life of stay in place farming Year round farming villages and early agricultural states such as those that cropped up in Mesopotamia exchanged mobile groups healthy lifestyles for the back breaking drudgery of cultivating crops exposure to infectious diseases inadequate diets taxes and conscription into armies In Against the Grain political anthropologist James C Scott offers a disturbing but enlightening defense of that position He draws on past and recent archaeological studies indicating that the emergence of state run societies around years ago represented a cultural step backward in some important ways Scott has previously written about modern states failed social engineering projects and the evasion of state control by present day mountain peoples in Southeast Asia Exploring the roots of state building was a logical next step Neither agriculture nor large settlements on their own stimulated state formation Scott argues Middle Eastern foragers cultivated grains thousands of years before year round villages appeared Large permanent settlements depending substantially on wild plants and marine food materialized in Mesopotamia well before agricultural states formed there Scott proposes that early states represented a shotgun marriage of farming and huge communities presided over by a new class of hyperambitious rulers State building began in wetland areas such as the Fertile Crescent with huge expanses of fertile soil There grain farming squeezed enough people and storable food into a small enough space to enable state control and tax collection Fledgling states were fragile often breaking into smaller entities or falling apart entirely Researchers have tended to overlook the possibility that apparent state collapses in the archaeological record involved intentional flights of subjects fed up with war taxes epidemics and crop failures Scott says He ends with a look at how herding groups both raided and abetted early agricultural states in Asia Nomads deftly robbed stores of food and goods from their neighbors then negotiated steep bribes in exchange for not attacking Mobile pastoralists eventually became trading partners bringing sedentary societies copper horses and slaves to name a few Herders were also mercenaries catching runaway slaves and repressing revolts Ironically Scott writes barbarians helped states become the dominant political players they are today Scott writes in a straightforward style largely free of scientific jargon He doesn t portray foraging and mobile lifestyles as utopian systems but a closer look at their cons as well as their pros would have painted a fuller picture of these people Still Scott s depiction of early centralized states problems rings true in a modern world of nation states People in the United States who wear contact lenses share an eye opening characteristic Roughly percent report regularly taking at least one risk when wearing or cleaning their lenses In the Aug Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report researchers at the U S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describe results from a national survey of more than people Contrary to previous studies teens did better in some categories than adults The no no s below can lead to serious eye infections mainly by introducing microorganisms into the eye Even water that s safe to drink or swim in can bug up lenses Subtle cosmic vibrations kicked up by swirling black holes have captured the public imagination and the minds of the physics Nobel Prize committee members too Three scientists who laid the groundwork for the first direct detection of gravitational waves have won the Nobel Prize in physics Rainer Weiss of MIT and Kip Thorne and Barry Barish both of Caltech will share the million Swedish kronor about million prize with half going to Weiss and the remainder split between Thorne and Barish Though researchers often wait decades for Nobel recognition the observation of gravitational waves was so monumental that the scientists were honored less than two years after the discovery s announcement These detections were so compelling and earth shattering Why wait says Clifford Will of the University of Florida in Gainesville who was not directly involved with the discovery It s fabulous Absolutely fabulous Weiss Thorne and Barish are pioneers of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory or LIGO On February LIGO scientists announced they had spotted gravitational waves produced by a pair of merging black holes This first ever detection generated a frenzy of excitement among physicists and garnered front page headlines around the world LIGO s observation of gravitational waves directly confirmed a year old prediction of Einstein s general theory of relativity that rapidly accelerating massive objects stretch and squeeze spacetime producing ripples that travel outward from the source SN p If Einstein was still alive it would be absolutely wonderful to go to him and tell him about the discovery He would be very pleased I m sure of it Weiss said during a news conference at MIT a few hours after he got word of the win But then to tell him what the discovery was that it was a black hole he would have been absolutely flabbergasted because he didn t believe in them As enthusiastic team members clad in LIGO themed T shirts celebrated the discovery Weiss stressed that the discovery was a group effort I m a symbol of that It s not all on my shoulders this thing he said citing the large collaboration of scientists whose work led up to LIGO s detection Physicists anticipate that LIGO will spark an entirely new field of astronomy in which scientists survey the universe by feeling for its tremors It will allow us to see the parts of the universe that were not revealed to us before says LIGO team member Carlos Lousto of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York LIGO s first incarnation which officially began collecting data in and ran intermittently until yielded no hints of gravitational waves After years of upgrades the souped up detectors known as Advanced LIGO began searching for spacetime ripples in Almost as soon as the detectors were turned on even before scientific data taking had formally begun scientists detected the minuscule undulations of their first black hole collision Those ripples spotted on September journeyed to Earth from billion light years away where they were produced by two colossal black holes that spiraled inward and merged into one SN p Quivers from those converging black holes when converted into an audio signal made a tell tale sound called a chirp reminiscent of a bird s cry The particulars of that signature reveal details of the collision The beauty of the symphony is in what you can extract from the tiny wiggles or the wiggles on tops of wiggles in that signal Thorne said at an Oct news conference at Caltech Since that first detection scientists have observed three more black hole collisions And additional gravitational ripples may already be in the bag It s rumored that LIGO scientists have also detected a smashup of neutron stars SN Online In fact Weiss teased an announcement to come on October An astounding feat of engineering LIGO consists of two enormous L shaped detectors that stretch across the wooded landscape of Livingston La and the desert of Hanford Wash Each detector boasts two kilometer long arms through which laser light bounces back and forth between mirrors Gravitational waves passing through a detector stretch one arm while shortening the other LIGO compares the arms sizes using the laser light to measure length differences a tiny fraction of the size of a proton Gravitational waves should produce signals in the two distant detectors nearly simultaneously helping scientists to rule out spurious signals that can be caused by events as mundane as a truck bouncing along nearby LIGO is probably one of the best and most amazing instruments ever built by mankind Barish said at the Caltech news conference But building it was a risky endeavor No one had previously attempted anything like it and no one could say for sure whether the effort would succeed What s fundamental is you have to be willing to take risks to do great things Barish said In August LIGO s two detectors teamed up with the similarly designed Virgo detector near Pisa Italy SN Online The latest gravitational wave sighting made on August showed up in all three detectors almost simultaneously which allowed scientists to pinpoint the region of space in which the black holes resided more precisely than ever before SN Online Weiss spent decades on the project beginning with nascent scribbles on scraps of paper and early prototypes In the s Weiss came up with the idea for a laser gravitational wave detector while teaching a class on general relativity Other researchers had independently proposed the technique as well He refined that idea and built a small prototype detector establishing the basic blueprint that would eventually evolve into LIGO As far as last meals go squid isn t a bad choice Cephalopod remains appear to dominate the stomach contents of a newly analyzed ichthyosaur fossil from nearly million years ago The ancient marine reptiles once roamed Jurassic seas and commonly pop up in England s fossil rich coast near Lyme Regis But a lot of ichthyosaur museum specimens lack records of where they came from making their age difficult to place Dean Lomax of the University of Manchester and his colleagues reexamined one such fossil Based on its skull they identified the creature as a newborn Ichthyosaurus communis Microfossils of shrimp and amoeba species around the ichthyosaur put the specimen at million to million years old the researchers estimate Tiny hook structures stand out in the newborn s ribs most likely the remnants of prehistoric black squid arms Another baby ichthyosaur fossil that lived more recently had a stomach full of fish scales So the new find suggests a shift in the menu for young ichthyosaurs at some point in their evolutionary history the researchers write October in Historical Biology Discoveries about the molecular ups and downs of fruit flies daily lives have won Jeffrey C Hall Michael Rosbashand Michael W Young the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine These three Americans were honored October by the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm for their work in discovering important gears in the circadian clocks of animals The trio will equally split the million Swedish kronor prize each taking home the equivalent of The researchers did their work in fruit flies But an awful lot of what was subsequently found out in the fruit flies turns out also to be true and of huge relevance to humans says John O Neill a circadian cell biologist at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge England Mammals humans included have circadian clocks that work with the same logic and many of the same gears found in fruit flies say Jennifer Loros and Jay Dunlap geneticists at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College Circadian clocks are networks of genes and proteins that govern daily rhythms and cycles such as sleep the release of hormones the rise and fall of body temperature and blood pressure as well as other body processes Circadian rhythms help organisms including humans anticipate and adapt to cyclic changes of light dark and temperature caused by Earth s rotation When circadian rhythms are thrown out of whack jet lag results Shift workers and people with chronic sleep deprivation experience long term jet lag that has been linked to serious health consequences including cancer diabetes heart disease obesity and depression Before the laureates did their work other scientists had established that plants and animals have circadian rhythms In Seymour Benzer and Ronald Konopka both now deceased and ineligible for the Nobel Prize found that fruit flies with mutations in a single gene called period had disrupted circadian rhythms which caused the flies to move around at different times of day than normal But then people got stuck says chronobiologist Erik Herzog of Washington University in St Louis We couldn t figure out what that gene was or how that gene worked At Brandeis University in Waltham Mass Hall a geneticist teamed up with molecular biologist Rosbash to identify the period gene at the molecular level in Young of the Rockefeller University in New York City simultaneously deciphered the gene s DNA makeup In the beginning we didn t even know the other group was working on it until we all showed up at a conference together and discovered we were working on the same thing says Young We said Well let s forge ahead Best of luck Six years after the Fukushima nuclear reactor disaster in Japan radioactive material is leaching into the Pacific Ocean from an unexpected place Some of the highest levels of radioactive cesium a major by product of nuclear power generation are now found in the somewhat salty groundwater beneath sand beaches tens of kilometers away a new study shows Scientists tested for radioactivity at eight different beaches within kilometers of the plant which experienced three reactor meltdowns when an earthquake and tsunami on March knocked out its power Oceans rivers and fresh groundwater sources are typically monitored for radioactivity following a nuclear accident but several years following the disaster those weren t the most contaminated water sources Instead brackish groundwater underneath the beaches has accumulated the second highest levels of the radioactive element surpassed only by the groundwater directly beneath the reactor researchers report October in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences In the wake of the accident seawater tainted with high levels of cesium probably traveled along the coast and lapped against these beaches proposes study coauthor Virginie Sanial who did the work while at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts Some cesium stuck to the sand and over time percolated down to the brackish groundwater beneath Now the radioactive material is steadily making its way back into the ocean The groundwater is releasing the cesium into the coastal ocean at a rate that s on par with the leakage of cesium into the ocean from the reactor site itself Sanial s team estimates Since this water isn t a source of drinking water and is underground the contamination isn t an immediate public health threat says Sanial now a geochemist at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg But with about half of the world s nuclear power plants located on coastlines such areas are potentially important contamination reservoirs and release sites to monitor after future accidents The reappearance of a long lost meteor shower has finally explained what happened to a missing comet named P Blanpain That comet was spotted only once in and never again unusual for a body orbiting the sun But in astronomers found a small asteroid moving along the Blanpain orbit suggesting the space rock might be the comet or a piece of it after it ejected much of its cometary dust Some of that dust may have been what Japanese researchers saw in when they observed a meteor shower from the constellation Phoenix Meteor showers occur when dust left behind by a comet burns up as it hits Earth s atmosphere Those Phoenicid meteors hadn t been seen before or since Astronomer Jun ichi Watanabe of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan in Tokyo and colleagues traced the meteors to where the comet s dust trail should have been In the group predicted that the remaining dust would create another shower in Team members traveled to North Carolina and Spain s Canary Islands to test their prediction and on the first two days of December they saw Phoenicids streak across the sky But there were about percent fewer meteors than expected Blanpain may have lost its dust more quickly than previously thought the team reports in the Sept Planetary and Space Science The astronomers will get a second chance to check another shower is expected in Discoveries about the clocklike ups and downs of daily life have won Jeffery C Hall Michael Rosbash and Michael W Young the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine Circadian rhythms are daily cycles of hormones gene activity and other biological processes that govern sleep body temperature and metabolism When thrown out of whack there can be serious health consequences including increased risk of diabetes heart and Alzheimer s diseases Hall and Rosbash discovered the first molecular gear of the circadian clockworks A protein called Period increases and decreases in abundance on a regular cycle during the day Young discovered that another protein called Timeless works with Period to drive the clock Young also discovered other circadian clockworks When you think about it it shouldn t be surprising that there s more than one way to explain quantum mechanics Quantum math is notorious for incorporating multiple possibilities for the outcomes of measurements So you shouldn t expect physicists to stick to only one explanation for what that math means And in fact sometimes it seems like researchers have proposed more interpretations of this math than Katy Perry has followers on Twitter So it would seem that the world needs more quantum interpretations like it needs more Category hurricanes But until some single interpretation comes along that makes everybody happy and that s about as likely as the Cleveland Browns winning the Super Bowl yet more interpretations will emerge One of the latest appeared recently September online at arXiv org the site where physicists send their papers to ripen before actual publication You might say papers on the arXiv are like potential publications which someday might become actual if a journal prints them And that in a nutshell is pretty much the same as the logic underlying the new interpretation of quantum physics In the new paper three scientists argue that including potential things on the list of real things can avoid the counterintuitive conundrums that quantum physics poses It is perhaps less of a full blown interpretation than a new philosophical framework for contemplating those quantum mysteries At its root the new idea holds that the common conception of reality is too limited By expanding the definition of reality the quantum s mysteries disappear In particular real should not be restricted to actual objects or events in spacetime Reality ought also be assigned to certain possibilities or potential realities that have not yet become actual These potential realities do not exist in spacetime but nevertheless are ontological that is real components of existence This new ontological picture requires that we expand our concept of what is real to include an extraspatiotemporal domain of quantum possibility write Ruth Kastner Stuart Kauffman and Michael Epperson Considering potential things to be real is not exactly a new idea as it was a central aspect of the philosophy of Aristotle centuries ago An acorn has the potential to become a tree a tree has the potential to become a wooden table Even applying this idea to quantum physics isn t new Werner Heisenberg the quantum pioneer famous for his uncertainty principle considered his quantum math to describe potential outcomes of measurements of which one would become the actual result The quantum concept of a probability wave describing the likelihood of different possible outcomes of a measurement was a quantitative version of Aristotle s potential Heisenberg wrote in his well known book Physics and Philosophy It introduced something standing in the middle between the idea of an event and the actual event a strange kind of physical reality just in the middle between possibility and reality In their paper titled Taking Heisenberg s Potentia Seriously Kastner and colleagues elaborate on this idea drawing a parallel to the philosophy of Ren Descartes Descartes in the th century proposed a strict division between material and mental substance Material stuff res extensa or extended things existed entirely independently of mental reality res cogitans things that think except in the brain s pineal gland There res cogitans could influence the body Modern science has of course rejected res cogitans The material world is all that reality requires Mental activity is the outcome of material processes such as electrical impulses and biochemical interactions Kastner and colleagues also reject Descartes res cogitans But they think reality should not be restricted to res extensa rather it should be complemented by res potentia in particular quantum res potentia not just any old list of possibilities Quantum potentia can be quantitatively defined a quantum measurement will with certainty always produce one of the possibilities it describes In the large scale world all sorts of possibilities can be imagined Browns win Super Bowl Indians win straight games which may or may not ever come to pass If quantum potentia are in some sense real Kastner and colleagues say then the mysterious weirdness of quantum mechanics becomes instantly explicable You just have to realize that changes in actual things reset the list of potential things Consider for instance that you and I agree to meet for lunch next Tuesday at the Mad Hatter restaurant Kastner and colleagues use the example of a coffee shop but I don t like coffee But then on Monday a tornado blasts the Mad Hatter to Wonderland Meeting there is no longer on the list of res potentia it s no longer possible for lunch there to become an actuality In other words even though an actuality can t alter a distant actuality it can change distant potential We could have been a thousand miles away yet the tornado changed our possibilities for places to eat It s an example of how the list of potentia can change without the spooky action at a distance that Einstein alleged about quantum entanglement Measurements on entangled particles such as two photons seem baffling You can set up an experiment so that before a measurement is made either photon could be spinning clockwise or counterclockwise Once one is measured though and found to be say clockwise you know the other will have the opposite spin counterclockwise no matter how far away it is But no secret signal is or could possibly be sent from one photon to the other after the first measurement It s simply the case that counterclockwise is no longer on the list of res potentia for the second photon An actuality the first measurement changes the list of potentia that still exist in the universe Potentia encompass the list of things that may become actual what becomes actual then changes what s on the list of potentia Similar arguments apply to other quantum mysteries Observations of a pure quantum state containing many possibilities turns one of those possibilities into an actual one And the new actual event constrains the list of future possibilities without any need for physical causation We simply allow that actual events can instantaneously and acausally affect what is next possible which in turn influences what can next become actual and so on Kastner and colleagues write Measurement they say is simply a real physical process that transforms quantum potentia into elements of res extensa actual real stuff in the ordinary sense Space and time or spacetime is something that emerges from a quantum substratum as actual stuff crystalizes out of a more fluid domain of possibles Spacetime therefore is not all there is to reality It s unlikely that physicists everywhere will instantly cease debating quantum mysteries and start driving cars with res potentia bumper stickers But whether this new proposal triumphs in the quantum debates or not it raises a key point in the scientific quest to understand reality Reality is not necessarily what humans think it is or would like it to be Many quantum interpretations have been motivated by a desire to return to Newtonian determinism for instance where cause and effect is mechanical and predictable like a clock s tick preceding each tock But the universe is not required to conform to Newtonian nostalgia And more generally scientists often presume that the phenomena nature offers to human senses reflect all there is to reality It is difficult for us to imagine or conceptualize any other categories of reality beyond the level of actual i e what is immediately available to us in perceptual terms Kastner and colleagues note Yet quantum physics hints at a deeper foundation underlying the reality of phenomena in other words that ontology encompasses more than just events and objects in spacetime This proposition sounds a little bit like advocating for the existence of ghosts But it is actually more of an acknowledgment that things may seem ghostlike only because reality has been improperly conceived in the first place Kastner and colleagues point out that the motions of the planets in the sky baffled ancient philosophers because supposedly in the heavens reality permitted only uniform circular motion accomplished by attachment to huge crystalline spheres Expanding the boundaries of reality allowed those motions to be explained naturally Similarly restricting reality to events in spacetime may turn out to be like restricting the heavens to rotating spheres Spacetime itself many physicists are convinced is not a primary element of reality but a structure that emerges from processes more fundamental Because these processes appear to be quantum in nature it makes sense to suspect that something more than just spacetime events has a role to play in explaining quantum physics True it s hard to imagine the reality of something that doesn t exist actually as an object or event in spacetime But Kastner and colleagues cite the warning issued by the late philosopher Ernan McMullin who pointed out that imaginability must not be made the test for ontology Science attempts to discover the real world s structures it s unwarranted McMullin said to require that those structures be imaginable in the categories known from large scale ordinary experience Sometimes things not imaginable do after all turn out to be real No fan of the team ever imagined the Indians would win games in a row Hackers take notice Ultrasecure quantum video chats are now possible across the globe In a demonstration of the world s first intercontinental quantum link scientists held a long distance videoconference on September between Austria and China To secure the communication a Chinese satellite distributed a quantum key a secret string of numbers used to encrypt the video transmission so that no one could eavesdrop on the conversation In the call chemist Chunli Bai president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing spoke with quantum physicist Anton Zeilinger president of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna It s a huge achievement says quantum physicist Thomas Jennewein of the University of Waterloo in Canada who was not involved with the project It s a major step to show that this approach could be viable Using a technique known as quantum key distribution scientists share secret strings of numbers while ensuring that no eavesdroppers can intercept the code undetected Those quantum keys are then used to encrypt information sent via traditional internet connections Decoding the transmission requires the same key used for encryption foiling would be snoops China s Micius satellite which launched in uses lasers to beam photons or light particles to ground stations on Earth Micius sent a series of photons encoding a string of s and s to a ground station near Beijing The satellite stored information about the sequence until it reached a station near Vienna where Micius beamed down another string of photons Then the satellite combined the two sets of numbers and relayed additional information to the stations to allow them to create matching keys Previously scientists have used Micius to distribute quantum keys between the satellite and the ground teleport the properties of photons from the ground into space SN Online and produce photons with their properties linked or entangled despite being separated by kilometers SN p The video chat marks the first time researchers were able to exchange quantum keys between two different continents Although the chat was not completely secure from hacking it was about a million times as secure as what s possible with standard or classical types of encryption says Rupert Ursin a physicist at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information in Vienna and a member of the Austrian team The Chinese and Austrian teams also exchanged images using theoretically uncrackable methods In the future scientists envision widespread quantum networks allowing secure communication worldwide We are facing now a new era of having a global quantum internet ready to be deployed Ursin says When Hurricane Maria s kilometer per hour winds slammed into Puerto Rico on September they spurred floods destroyed roads and flattened homes across the island A week and a half later parts of the island remain without power and its people are facing a humanitarian crisis The storm also temporarily knocked out one of the best and biggest eyes on the sky the Arecibo Observatory some kilometers west of San Juan The observatory s meter wide main dish was until recently the largest radio telescope in the world a bigger one the FAST radio telescope opened in China in As news trickled out over the past week it appeared that the damage may not be as bad as initially reported The observatory is conserving fuel but plans to resume limited astronomy observations September deputy director Joan Schmelz tweeted earlier that day AreciboScience is coming back after MariaPR But the direct whack still raises the issue of when and even whether to repair the observatory Funding for it has repeatedly been on the chopping block despite its historic contributions to astronomy Arecibo s recent work includes searching for gravitational waves by the effect they have on the clocklike regularity of dead stars called pulsars watching for mysterious blasts of energy called fast radio bursts SN Online and keeping tabs on near Earth asteroids It played a key role in the history of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence In astronomers Frank Drake Jill Tarter and Carl Sagan used it to send messages to any extraterrestrial civilizations that might be listening SN Online It was also the telescope that in discovered the first planets outside the solar system Arecibo also holds a special place in my personal history Watching actress Jodie Foster use the giant dish to listen for aliens in the movie Contact when I was cemented my desire to study astronomy I chose to go to Cornell University for undergrad in part because the university managed Arecibo at the time and I hoped I might get to go there I never did but my undergrad adviser Martha Haynes uses Arecibo to study the distribution of galaxies in the local universe And one of the first science stories I ever had published was about Cornell professors testifying to the National Science Foundation which owns Arecibo to defend the observatory s funding Ten years after that story ran in the Cornell Daily Sun Arecibo s funding situation is still in doubt It s not clear how the recent damage will affect its future Telescope operator ngel V zquez sent the first damage reports via short wave radio on September A line feed antenna used to receive and transmit radio waves to study the Earth s ionosphere broke off and fell onto the observatory s main dish damaging some of its panels A second meter dish was thought to have been destroyed entirely But the smaller dish survived with only minor damage Initial reports said it had just been blown away but it turned out that was not correct says Nicholas White of the Universities Space Research Association which co operates the observatory with SRI International a nonprofit headquartered in Menlo Park Calif and Metropolitan University in San Juan Puerto Rico That looks like it s fine although obviously we have to get up there and check it out On September observatory director Francisco C rdova posted a picture to the observatory s Facebook page of two staff members standing in front of the big telescope dish with an outstretched Puerto Rican flag Still standing after HurricaneMaria the post declares We suffered some damages but nothing that can t be repaired or replaced The line feed antenna is a big loss but it should be replaceable eventually White says And the damage to the main dish is fixable Among the tasks was to get inside the Gregorian dome the golf ball like structure suspended over the giant dish and make sure the reflectors within it were aligned correctly Those reflectors were knocked askew by Hurricane George in says Cornell radio astronomer Donald Campbell Meantime Arecibo staff who managed to safely shelter in place during the storm have been showing up for work funnily enough White says People just want to get back to normal But normal is also a state of uncertainty The NSF which foots million of the observatory s nearly million a year operating costs has been trying to offload their responsibility for it for several years NASA covers the balance And NSF s agreement with the three groups that jointly maintain and operate the observatory runs out in March In the NSF called for proposals for other organizations to take over after that The NSF can t estimate yet how expensive the repairs will be or how long they will take to complete so it s reserving comment on how the damage will affect decisions about the observatory s future We need to make a complete assessment says NSF program director Joseph Pesce Personally I hope the observatory remains open both for science and for inspiration I m still waiting for a reply to that Arecibo message Ice in space may break out the bubbly Zapping simulated space ice with imitation starlight makes the ice bubble like champagne If this happens in space this liquidlike behavior could help organic molecules form at the edges of infant planetary systems The experiment provides a peek into the possible origins of life Shogo Tachibana of Hokkaido University in Sapporo Japan and colleagues combined water methanol and ammonia all found in comets and interstellar clouds where stars form at a temperature between Celsius and C The team then exposed this newly formed ice to ultraviolet radiation to mimic the light of a young star As the ice warmed to C it cracked like a brittle solid But at just five degrees warmer bubbles started appearing in the ice and continued to bubble and pop until the ice reached C At that point the ice returned to a solid state and formed crystals We were so surprised when we first saw bubbling of ice at really low temperatures Tachibana says The team reports its finding September in Science Advances Follow up experiments showed fewer bubbles formed in ice with less methanol and ammonia Ice that wasn t irradiated showed no bubbles at all Analyses traced spikes of hydrogen gas during irradiation That suggests that the bubbles are made of hydrogen that the ultraviolet light split off methane and ammonia molecules Tachibana says It is like bubbling in champagne he says with an exception Champagne bubbles are dissolved carbon dioxide while ice bubbles are dissolved hydrogen The irradiated ice took on another liquidlike feature Between about C and C it flowed like refrigerated honey despite being well below its melting temperature Tachibana adds That liquidity could help kick start life building chemistry In Cornelia Meinert of the University Nice Sophia Antipolis in France and colleagues showed that irradiated ice forms a cornucopia of molecules essential to life including ribose the backbone of RNA which may have been a precursor to DNA SN p But it was not clear how smaller molecules could have found each other and built ribose in rigid ice At the time critics said complex molecules could have been contamination says Meinert who was not involved in the new work Now this is helping us argue that at this very low temperature the small precursor molecules can actually react with each other she says This is supporting the idea that all these organic molecules can form in the ice and might also be present in comets I recently wrote about the power that adults words can have on young children Today I m writing about the power of adults actions Parents know of course that their children keep a close eye on them But a new study provides a particularly good example of a watch and learn moment Toddlers who saw an adult struggle before succeeding were more likely to persevere themselves Toddlers are very capable learners says study coauthor Julia Leonard a cognitive developmental psychologist at MIT Scientists have found that these youngsters pick up on abstract concepts and new words after just a few exposures But it wasn t clear whether watching adults actions would actually change the way toddlers tackle a problem To see whether toddlers could soak up an adult s persistence Leonard and her colleagues tested to month olds the average age was months Some of the children watched an experimenter try to retrieve a toy stuck inside a container In some cases the experimenter quickly got the toy out three times within seconds easy Other times the experimenter struggled for the entire seconds before finally getting the toy out The experimenter then repeated the process for a different problem removing a carabiner toy from a keychain Some kids didn t see any experimenter demonstration Just after watching an adult struggle or not the toddlers were given a light up cube It had a big useless button on one side Another button small and hidden actually controlled the lights The kids knew the toy could light up but didn t know how to turn the lights on Though the big button did nothing that didn t stop the children from poking it But here s the interesting part Compared with toddlers who had just watched an adult succeed effortlessly or not watched an adult do anything at all the toddlers who had seen the adult struggle pushed the button more These kids persisted even though they never found success The sight of an adult persevering nudged the children toward trying harder themselves the researchers conclude in the Sept Science Leonard cautions that it s hard to pull parenting advice from a single laboratory based study but still there may be some value in letting children see you work hard to achieve your goals she says Observing the adults wasn t the only thing that determined the toddlers persistence not by a long shot Some kids might simply be more tenacious than others In the experiments some of the children who didn t see an experimenter attempt a task or who saw an experimenter quickly succeed were incredibly gritty Leonard says And some of the kids who watched a persistent adult still gave up quickly themselves That s not to mention the fact that these toddlers were occasionally tired hungry and cranky all of which can affect whether they give up easily Despite all of this variation the copycat effect remained so that kids were more likely to persist when they had just seen a persistent adult As Leonard says this is just one study and it can t explain the complex lives of toddlers Still one thing is clear and it s something that we would all do well to remember Infants are watching your behavior attentively and actively learning from what you do Leonard says The tsunami that devastated Japan s coast cast an enormous amount of debris out to sea way out Japanese marine life took advantage of the new floating real estate and booked a one way trip to America From to at least living Japanese marine species washed up on the shores of North America and Hawaii hitching rides on fishing boats docks buoys crates and other nonbiodegradable objects a team of U S researchers report in the Sept Science Organisms that surprisingly survived the harsh kilometer journey across the Pacific Ocean on items of tsunami debris ranged from centimeter long fish a Western Pacific yellowtail amberjack to microscopic single celled protists About percent of the species have never been seen in North America s Pacific waters If these newcomers become established they have the potential to become invasive disrupting native marine habitats says study coauthor James Carlton a marine scientist at Williams College in Mystic Conn Meet some of the slimiest strangest and potentially most invasive marine castaways that took this incredible journey The Northern Pacific sea star Asterias amurensis is among the world s most invasive species Though this purple and yellow sea star is normally found in shallow habitats it can live as deep as meters Skeleton shrimp Caprella cristibrachium and C mutica shown grasp onto algae with their strong rear claws earning them the nickname praying mantis of the sea These lanky amphipods can grow up to about centimeters long and are found in the Sea of Japan A white brittle Bryozoan Biflustra grandicella that can grow as big as a basketball is already invasive in Australia The tiny swimming larvae of these sea creatures also known as moss animals may live up to a week long enough to settle in to a new habitat Most of the wooden Japanese debris items collected carried at least one of seven species of large wormlike mollusks called Japanese shipworms Psiloteredo sp Some of the more monstrous shipworms found which bore into everything from wooden pilings to docks had grown to about centimeters long Five Japanese barred knifejaw fish Oplegnathus fasciatus also known as striped beakfish were found trapped in the stern well of a Japanese fishing boat found beached in in Washington These black and white striped fish are native to the Northwest Pacific Ocean and Hawaii The well acted as a tide pool of sorts sustaining the fish during their two year journey The wavy shelled slipper snail Crepidula onyx also known as a slipper limpet has essentially come full circle in its journey around the Pacific Ocean Native to the U S West Coast the well traveled snail became an invasive species in Japan and now has returned to America on Japanese debris A boy who lived in what s now South Africa nearly years ago has lent a helping genome to science Using the long gone youngster s genetic instruction book scientists have estimated that humans emerged as a distinct population earlier than typically thought between and years ago The trick was retrieving a complete version of the ancient boy s DNA from his skeleton to compare with DNA from people today and from Stone Age Neandertals and Denisovans Previously documented migrations of West African farmers to East Africa around years ago and then to southern Africa around years ago reshaped Africans genetics and obscured ancient ancestry patterns more than has been known the researchers report online September in Science The ancient boy s DNA was not affected by those migrations As a result it provides the best benchmark so far for gauging when Homo sapiens originated in Africa evolutionary geneticist Carina Schlebusch of Uppsala University in Sweden and her colleagues conclude In line with the new genetically derived age estimate for human origins another team has proposed that approximately year old fossils found in northwestern Africa belonged to H sapiens SN p Some researchers suspect a skull from South Africa s Florisbad site dated to around years ago qualifies as H sapiens But investigators often place our species origins close to years ago SN p There is broad consensus that several fossils from that time represent H sapiens Debate over the timing of human origins will continue despite the new evidence from the child whose remains came from previous shoreline excavations near the town of Ballito Bay says Uppsala University evolutionary geneticist and study coauthor Mattias Jakobsson We don t know if early Homo sapiensfossils or the Florisbad individual were genetically related to the Ballito Bay boy he says Thus the precise timing of humankind s emergence and exact patterns of divergence among later human populations remain unclear Researchers have yet to retrieve DNA from fossils dating between and years old that either securely or possibly belong to H sapiens A single genetic mutation made the Zika virus far more dangerous by enhancing its ability to kill nerve cells in developing brains a new study suggests The small change which tweaks just one amino acid in a protein that helps Zika exit cells may cause microcephaly researchers report September in Science The mutation arose around May shortly before a Zika outbreak in French Polynesia the researchers calculate Zika virus was discovered decades ago but wasn t associated with microcephaly a birth defect characterized by a small head and brain until the outbreak in Brazil Women who had contracted the virus while pregnant started giving birth to babies with the condition at higher than usual rates SN p Researchers weren t sure why microcephaly suddenly became a complication of Zika infections says Pei Yong Shi a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston Maybe the virus did cause microcephaly before scientists suggested but at such low rates that no one noticed Or people in South America might be more vulnerable to the virus Perhaps their immune systems don t know how to fight it they have a genetic susceptibility or prior infections with dengue made Zika worse SN p But Shi and colleagues in China thought the problem might be linked to changes in the virus itself The researchers compared a strain of Zika isolated from a patient in Cambodia in with three Zika strains collected from patients who contracted the virus in Venezuela Samoa and Martinique during the epidemic of The team found seven differences between the Cambodian virus and the three epidemic strains Researchers engineered seven versions of the Cambodian virus each with one of the epidemic strains mutations and injected the viruses into fetal mouse brains Viruses with one of these mutations dubbed S N killed brain cells in fetal mice and destroyed human brain cells grown in lab dishes more aggressively than the Cambodian strain from did the researchers found That s pretty convincing evidence that it at least plays some role in what we re seeing now says Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases The mutation changes an amino acid in a Zika protein called prM That protein helps the virus mature within infected cells and get out of the cells to infect others Shi and colleagues don t yet know why tweaking the protein makes the virus kill brain cells more readily The alteration in that protein probably isn t the entire reason epidemic strains cause microcephaly Shi says The Cambodian strain also led to the death of a few brain cells but perhaps not enough to cause microcephaly We believe there are other changes in the virus that collectively enhance its virulence he says In May in Nature Shi and colleagues described a different mutation that allows the virus to infect mosquitoes more effectively Brain cells from different people vary in their susceptibility to Zika infections says infectious disease researcher Scott Weaver also at the University of Texas Medical Branch but not involved in the study He says more work on human cells and in nonhuman primates is needed to confirm whether this mutation is really the culprit in microcephaly The world s tropical forests are exhaling and it s not a sigh of relief Instead of soaking up climate warming gases on balance these so called lungs of the planet are beginning to release them A new study based on analyses of satellite imagery of tropical Asia Africa and the Americas suggests that tropical forests contribute more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than they remove Much of that carbon contribution is due to deforestation the conversion of forests to urban spaces such as farms or roads But more than two thirds comes from a less visible source a decline in the number and diversity of trees in remaining forests researchers report online September in Science Tropical forests are a bulwark against rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere taking up carbon and storing it as stems leaves and roots Deforestation s effect is clear it cuts the number of trees that take up CO But even seemingly intact forests can be degraded or disturbed by selective logging environmental change wildfires or disease Unlike deforestation which is easy to see in satellite images these other kinds of degradation can be hard to spot says study lead author Alessandro Baccini a forest ecologist and remote sensing specialist at the Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth Mass A degraded forest still looks like forest it s just less dense containing less carbon biomass Carbon density is a weight Baccini says The problem is that there is no satellite in space that can give an estimate of weight So Baccini and his colleagues devised their own First they came up with a way to calibrate satellite images of the tropics using field observations and NASA Light Detection and Ranging Data or lidar Then they created an algorithm that compares meter square parcels of each image from each year from to to calculate gains and losses in carbon density In total the researchers found tropical forests emit teragrams of carbon to the atmosphere annually more than all cars in the United States did in and absorb only teragrams of carbon each year Of that net loss of carbon to the atmosphere percent is from degraded forests and the rest from deforestation Some percent of those carbon emissions came from tropical America including the Amazon Basin Africa s tropical forests were responsible for about percent of the carbon loss and Asia s forests for percent The results are a wake up call that there is an opportunity for improvement says study coauthor Wayne Walker also a forest ecologist and remote sensing specialist at Woods Hole Research Center Forests are low hanging fruit Maintaining forests intact and attempting to restore forests where they might have been lost is relatively straightforward and inexpensive Nancy Harris the research manager of the forest program at the World Resources Institute in Washington D C also sees opportunity in these findings We ve known for a long time that forest degradation is happening but haven t had a good way to measure it Harris says This paper goes a long way to capturing it in an empirical way But terrestrial ecosystem scientist Joshua Fisher of NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena Calif notes that this forest biomass study doesn t fully gel with atmospheric observations of carbon emissions from tropical forests which still show that the forests are taking up more carbon than they are emitting overall That may be because the new study focuses on aboveground biomass and doesn t include what s absorbed in soils he says Still Fisher says the study shows how important it is to include forest degradation as well as deforestation in studies of climate change It s a good first step for future analyses he adds Common bedbugs have a thing for dirty laundry New research suggests that in the absence of humans to latch onto the bloodsuckers flock to clothing doused in that certain gym bag je ne sais quoi Bedbugs Cimex lectularius rely on a variety of sights smells and changes in temperature as clues for the opportune moment to emerge from hiding and search for a blood meal To investigate what happens in the absence of an unsuspecting host William Hentley and his colleagues at the University of Sheffield in England set up two fake bedrooms Each had two bags of clothes one dirty and one clean and one room also had a steady flow of carbon dioxide to simulate human breathing Unsurprisingly the whiff of carbon dioxide strongly drew bedbugs out from hiding to look for food but didn t necessarily point the insects in a specific direction But in both rooms more bugs congregated in and around the dirty clothes bag than the clean one Residual human odor compounds probably draw in the bugs This is the first experimental evidence that bedbugs may hitch rides in travelers laundry to new destinations Hentley and his colleagues write September in Scientific Reports The gravitational wave paparazzi have tracked down the cosmic neighborhood of two merging black holes Scientists pinpointed the region in the sky where the two black holes violently melded and kicked up swirls of the spacetime ripples locating their stomping grounds more precisely than ever before Researchers from LIGO the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory and its sister experiment Advanced Virgo spotted the ripples on August The team announced the finding September at a news conference at a meeting of the G science ministers in Turin Italy and in a paper accepted in Physical Review Letters It s the first gravitational wave sighting to be made with three detectors LIGO s two detectors in Livingston La and Hanford Wash and Virgo s detector near Pisa Italy The three detector network really opens up a new potential and we are going to make the most of that potential in the future said Virgo scientist Fr d rique Marion of the Laboratoire d Annecy de Physique des Particules in France The trio of detectors allowed scientists to trace the source of the waves to a spot in the sky with an area of just square degrees Viewed in the night sky the size of that region is about times that of the full moon as seen from Earth The ripples journeyed to Earth from about billion light years away in a region near the constellation Eridanus in the southern sky LIGO has previously detected three black hole crashes with its two detectors in each case scientists carved out a swath of sky from which the waves could have come but could not discern a more specific cosmic birthplace The newfound black holes were located within a region about a tenth the size of those associated with previous detections Because gravitational waves take time to complete the cross planet jaunt from one detector to another the three detectors spotted the signal at slightly different times LIGO s Livingston detector saw the waves first followed by the LIGO Hanford detector milliseconds later and by the Virgo detector another milliseconds after that By analyzing these delays and the patterns of the ripples each detector saw scientists were able to deduce what direction they came from Scientists estimated the colliding black holes masses at about and times the sun s mass During the collision approximately three solar masses were converted into energy and radiated as gravitational waves leaving behind a solar mass black hole The LIGO and Virgo detectors teamed up August SN Online when Virgo began officially taking data for the first time in its current upgraded form Previous incarnations of both LIGO and Virgo ran for years without detecting a whiff of spacetime wiggles Now the detectors are finally sensitive enough to pick up the tiny tremors The improved trio operated in tandem until August when the detectors shut down for further improvements Virgo also allowed scientists to better test Einstein s general theory of relativity Because Virgo s detector isn t oriented parallel to the LIGO detectors scientists could study the polarization of the waves the specific pattern by which they stretch and squeeze spacetime for the first time In the long run that s a really big deal says physicist Clifford Will of the University of Florida in Gainesville who was not involved with the detection If unexpected kinds of stretching or squeezing were found it would kill general relativity just like that That would be the end But Einstein s theory held its ground Scouting out the locales where black hole pairs live allows astronomers to look for light produced in the collision Although most scientists expect that no light will be emitted in black hole dust ups some theories suggest otherwise After the ripples were detected telescopes scoured the spot but observations came up empty Other kinds of collisions however between two remnants of stars called neutron stars could produce light Therefore the new detection is good preparation for what s to come says physicist Emanuele Berti of the University of Mississippi in Oxford who was not involved with the detection Spotting light from a neutron star pileup could help scientists learn more about the extremely dense material that makes up neutron stars In August rumors began flying that scientists had detected such an event SN Online If the rumor is true Berti says with two detections in one month they ve made giant strides Saber toothed kittens were the spitting image of their parents Even as babies the cats not only had the oversized canine teeth but also unusually powerful forelimbs Katherine Long a graduate student at California State Polytechnic University in Pomona and colleagues report September in PLOS ONE As adults the ferocious felines used those strong forelimbs to secure wriggling prey before slashing a throat or belly thereby avoiding breaking off a tooth in the struggle Paleontologists have puzzled over whether saber toothed cats such as Smilodon fatalis developed those robust limbs as they grew To compare the growth rate of Smilodon with that of similar sized non saber toothed cats that lived alongside it Long and her team turned to fossils collected from the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles The ancient asphalt traps hold a wealth of species and specimens from juveniles to adults dating to between and years ago The Smilodon bones they found did not show any evidence of an unusual growth spurt Instead the bones grew longer and slimmer as the kittens grew up following the same developmental pattern as the other large cats That suggests that when it comes to their mighty forelimbs Smilodon kittens were just born that way Robots are taking dress for success to a whole other level A new type of shape shifting robot can undergo complete metamorphosis in a matter of minutes The bot is composed of a simple metal cube that wraps itself in various high tech origami sheets that fold into wings wheels and other appendages for getting around By donning and doffing different origami exoskeletons the metal core can quickly switch from a walking to rolling to sailing bot and back again It s almost like putting clothes on the robot to give it different kinds of powers says study coauthor Daniela Rus a roboticist at MIT Such quickly customizable machines described online September in Science Robotics could be useful for everything from surgery to space travel At the heart of each tiny transformer is a magnetic cube a few millimeters across which Rus team drove using magnetic coils of wire called solenoids as remote controls To enclose this magnetic engine inside an origami body the researchers parked the cube atop an unfolded origami sheet a layer of the heat shrinking material the same kind used to make Shrinky Dinks sandwiched between two panes of polyester Along the fold lines the researchers had peeled away strips of polyester to expose the shrinking film When the researchers cranked up a heating pad underneath the origami sheet to Celsius the heat shrinking material along the creases contracted causing the sheet to fold into a D body dubbed Walk bot that allowed the bot to amble Rus team then used the same method to encompass the Walk bot body inside other origami exoskeletons to create a bigger Walk bot Wheel bot Boat bot or Glider bot Once the robot was all suited up Rus and colleagues used the solenoids to make it walk or roll sail on water or glide through the air The outer exoskeletons were fastened into place with four latches made of water soluble material allowing Walk bot to shuck its origami outerwear by getting these clasps wet Then leaving the used exoskeleton behind Walk bot could enfold itself in a new origami body Future exoskeleton designs could arm robots with drills scissors shovels or grippers Such adaptable robots may be used for incision free surgery says Antoine Cully a roboticist at Imperial College London who was not involved in the study A patient could ingest a magnetic core and various exoskeletons which a surgeon would then remotely control from outside the body Shape shifting robots could also be useful in other situations where they must perform a wide range of tasks without packing lots of spare parts like during natural disaster emergency response operations or on space missions The largest marsupial to ever walk the Earth just got another accolade It s also the only marsupial known to migrate seasonally Diprotodon optatum was a massive wombat like herbivore that lived in what s now Australia and New Guinea during the Pleistocene until about years ago Now an analysis of one animal s teeth suggests that it undertook long seasonal migrations like those made by zebras and wildebeests in Africa Animals pick up the chemical element strontium through their diet and it leaves a record in their teeth The ratio of different strontium isotopes varies from place to place so it can provide clues about where an animal lived Strontium isotope ratios in an incisor from one D optatum revealed a repeating pattern That suggests the animal migrated seasonally it moved around but generally hit up the same rest stops each year researchers report September in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B It s the first evidence to show a marsupial living or extinct migrating in this way says study coauthor Gilbert Price a paleoecologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane Australia It s not clear exactly why this mega marsupial might have migrated but an analysis of the carbon isotopes in its teeth suggests it ate a fairly limited diet So it might have migrated to follow food sources that popped up seasonally in different places the authors suggest The life of a jellyfish may seem like a real snooze but until now biologists were never certain if the gelatinous blobs actually slept Now it appears that at least one group of jellyfish needs its beauty sleep just like us Some species of upside down jellyfish Cassiopea meet all of the criteria for entering a sleeplike state a group of Caltech researchers report September in Current Biology The jellyfish seem groggy after a sleepless night and quickly waken from their slumber when fed experiments show It s a surprising find Sleep and sleeplike states have been documented in a wide range of animals from microscopic wormlike nematodes to of course humans SN p But until now the behavior has been observed only in animals with a centralized nervous system and brain Jellyfish operate on a decentralized net of nerve cells It s the first animal that doesn t have a centralized nervous system that also sleeps that we know of says biology graduate student and coauthor Ravi Nath Adds coauthor Michael Abrams Sleep is not solely generated by animals with brains The finding is raising new questions about when and why sleep evolved Jellyfish are cnidarians an ancient lineage of animals that evolved at least million years ago So if Cassiopea jellyfish in fact sleep it suggests that sleep is one of the most basic requirements of life And unlike in humans where sleep has been linked to such brain functions as retaining memories the same can t be said of the role of sleep for jellyfish Finding sleep in jellyfish thus raises the question of whether sleep and nervous system functions are intertwined says William Joiner a neuroscientist at the University of California San Diego or alternatively whether sleep arose before the inception of the nervous system to fulfill an as yet unidentified physiological need Upside down jellyfish spend most of their time resting their gelatinous bodies or bells on the seafloor with their stubby arms and tentacles sticking up The animals regularly pulse their bells to filter feed and get rid of waste To qualify as sleeping beings the jellyfish had to pass three tests First did they become less active at a particular time By monitoring the pulsing of upside down jellyfish day and night for six days the researchers discovered that the animals pulsed percent less at night The team could easily reverse this sleepy state by dropping food into the tank The jellyfish immediately responded to the stimulus and started pulsing more Nath says Second were the jellyfish less responsive at certain times For people that would be like if you re asleep you are less likely to respond to someone talking to you says Abrams Since Cassiopea prefer to swim down to settle on a surface the researchers hoisted up a jellyfish in a plastic pipe with mesh on the bottom let the animal settle for five minutes and then quickly lowered the pipe That action effectively placed the jellyfish free floating into the water column At night the researchers found it took the jellyfish longer to begin pulsing and reach the bottom of the tank than during the day Finally do the jellyfish need regular periods of sleep in order to survive After keeping jellyfish active for up to hours overnight by squirting them with pulses of water the jellyfish were significantly less active the following morning That sluggishness shows that the jellyfish needed to make up for the loss of rest says coauthor Claire Bedbrook The authors do a good job of demonstrating that jellyfish fulfill the most fundamental criteria for sleep Joiner says A bigger question for cnidarians and most animals is not only if they sleep but why Jellyfish sleep can hardly be compared with human sleep Abrams says but by studying the creatures we might be able to get at those core fundamental components of why something sleeps When things heat up spinning electrons go their separate ways Warming one end of a strip of platinum shuttles electrons around according to their spin a quantum property that makes them behave as if they are twirling around Known as the spin Nernst effect the newly detected phenomenonwas the only one in a cadre of related spin effects that hadn t previously been spotted researchers report online September in Nature Materials The last missing piece in the puzzle was spin Nernst and that s why we set out to search for this says study coauthor Sebastian Goennenwein a physicist at the Technical University of Dresden in Germany The effect and its brethren with names like the spin Hall effect the spin Seebeck effect and the spin Peltier effect allow scientists to create flows of electron spins or spin currents Such research could lead to smaller and more efficient electronic gadgets that use electrons spins to store and transmit information instead of electric charge a technique known as spintronics In the spin Nernst effect named after Nobel laureate chemist Walther Nernst heating one end of a metal causes electrons to flow toward the other end bouncing around inside the material as they go Within certain materials that bouncing has a preferred direction Electrons with spins pointing up as if twirling counterclockwise go to the right and electrons with spins pointing down as if twirling clockwise go to the left creating an overall spin current Although the effect had been predicted no one had yet observed it Finding evidence of the effect required disentangling it from other heat and charge related effects that occur in materials To do so the researchers coupled the platinum to a layer of a magnetic insulator a material known as yttrium iron garnet Then they altered the direction of the insulator s magnetization which changed whether the spin current could flow through the insulator That change slightly altered a voltage measured along the strip of platinum The scientists measured how this voltage changed with the direction of the magnetization to isolate the fingerprints of the spin Nernst effect The measurement was a tour de force the measurement was ridiculously hard says physicist Joseph Heremans of Ohio State University in Columbus who was not involved with the research The effect could help scientists to better understand materials that may be useful for building spintronic devices he says It s really a new set of eyes on the physics of what s going on inside these devices A relative of the spin Nernst effect called the spin Hall effect is much studied for its potential use in spintronic devices In the spin Hall effect an electric field pushes electrons through a material and the particles veer off to the left and right depending on their spin The spin Nernst effect relies on the same basic physics but uses heat instead of an electric field to get the particles moving It s a beautiful experiment It shows very nicely the spin Nernst effect says physicist Greg Fuchs of Cornell University It beautifully unifies our understanding of the interrelation between charge heat and spin transport Nearly in adolescents has suffered at least one concussion a survey of teens finds And percent reported being diagnosed with two or more concussions in their lifetimes researchers report in the September JAMA About eighth th and th graders took part in the Monitoring the Future survey an annual national survey of adolescent behavior and health given in schools Among other questions teens were asked whether they had ever had a head injury that was diagnosed as a concussion percent had Those teens were more likely to participate in competitive sports and be male white and in a higher grade While past studies have found that kids taking part in contact sports have a higher risk of suffering a concussion the authors of the new study note that data are lacking on how many U S adolescents have had concussions information that s vital to prevention efforts A Neandertal child whose partial skeleton dates to around years ago grew at the same pace as children do today with a couple of exceptions Growth of the child s spine and brain lagged a new study finds It s unclear though whether developmental slowing in those parts of the body applied only to Neandertals or to Stone Age Homo sapiens as well If so environmental conditions at the time which are currently hard to specify may have reduced the pace of physical development similarly in both Homo species This ancient youngster died at years of age say paleoanthropologist Antonio Rosas of the National Museum of Natural Sciences in Madrid and colleagues The scientists estimated the child s age by counting microscopic enamel layers that accumulated daily as a molar tooth formed Previous excavations uncovered the child s remains as well as fossils of other Neandertals at a cave site in northwestern Spain called El Sidr n Much but not all of the Neandertal child s skeleton had matured to a point expected for present day youngsters of the same age the scientists report in the Sept Science But bones at the top and in the middle of the spine had not fully fused corresponding to a stage of development typical of to year olds today Also the ancient child s brain was still growing at an age when living humans brains have nearly or fully reached adult size Signs of bone tissue being reshaped on the inner surface of the child s braincase pointed to ongoing brain expansion Rosas team calculated that the youngster s brain volume was about percent of that expected on average for Neandertal adults Neandertals slightly larger brains relative to people today may have required more energy and thus more time to grow the researchers suggest And they suspect that the growth of Neandertals bigger torsos and perhaps spinal cords slowed the extinct species backbone development in late childhood Rosas new study reinforces what should have been apparent for some time that Neandertal growth rates and patterns except for those related to well known differences in skeletal shape rarely differ from modern human variations says paleoanthropologist Erik Trinkaus of Washington University in St Louis But researchers need to compare the El Sidr n child to fossils of H sapiens youngsters from the same time or later in the Stone Age Trinkaus adds Relative to kids today ancient human youth may display slower growth rates comparable to those of the Neandertal child he suspects Frog brains get busy long before they re fully formed Just a day after fertilization embryonic brains begin sending signals to far off places in the body helping oversee the layout of complex patterns of muscles and nerve fibers And when the brain is missing bodily chaos ensues researchers report online September in Nature Communications The results from brainless embryos and tadpoles broaden scientists understanding of the types of signals involved in making sure bodies develop correctly says developmental biologist Catherine McCusker of the University of Massachusetts Boston Scientists are familiar with short range signals among nearby cells that help pattern bodies But because these newly described missives travel all the way from the brain to the far reaches of the body they are the first example of really long range signals she says Celia Herrera Rincon of Tufts University in Medford Mass and colleagues came up with a simple approach to tease out the brain s influence on the growing body Just one day after fertilization the scientists lopped off the still forming brains of African clawed frog embryos These embryos survive to become tadpoles even without brains a quirk of biology that allowed the researchers to see whether the brain is required for the body s development The answer was a definite and surprising yes Herrera Rincon says Long before the brain is mature it s already organizing and guiding organ behavior she says Brainless tadpoles had bungled patterns of muscles Normally muscle fibers form a stacked chevron pattern But in tadpoles lacking a brain this pattern didn t form correctly The borders between segments are all wonky says study coauthor Michael Levin also of Tufts University They can t keep a straight line Nerve fibers that crisscross tadpoles bodies also grew in an abnormal pattern Levin and colleagues noticed extra nerve fibers snaking across the brainless tadpoles in a chaotic pattern a nerve network that shouldn t be there he says Muscle and nerve abnormalities are the most obvious differences But brainless tadpoles probably have more subtle defects in other parts of their bodies such as the heart The search for those defects is the subject of ongoing experiments Levin says In addition to keeping patterns on point the young frog brain may protect its body from chemical assaults A molecule that binds to certain proteins on cells in the body had no effect on normal embryos But when given to brainless embryos the same molecule caused their spinal cords and tails to grow crooked These results suggest that early in development brains keep embryos safe from agents that would otherwise cause harm The brain is instructing cells that are really a long way away from it Levin says While the precise identities of these long range signals aren t known the researchers have some ideas When brainless embryos were dosed with a drug that targets cells that typically respond to the chemical messenger acetylcholine the muscle pattern improved Similarly the addition of a protein called HCN that can tweak the activity of cells also seemed to improve muscle development More work is needed before scientists know whether these interventions are actually mimicking messaging from the early brain and if so how Frog development isn t the same as mammalian development but frog development is pretty applicable to human biology McCusker says In fundamental ways humans and frogs are built from the same molecular toolbox she says So the results hint that a growing human brain might also interact similarly with a growing human body It s hard not to compliment kids on certain things When my little girls fancy themselves up in tutus which is every single time we leave the house people tell them how pretty they are I know these folks intentions are good but an abundance of compliments on clothes and looks sends messages I d rather my girls didn t absorb at ages and Or ever for that matter Our words often spoken casually and without much thought can have a big influence on little kids views of themselves and their behaviors That s very clear from two new studies on children who were praised for being smart The studies conducted in China on children ages and suggest that directly telling kids they re smart or that other people think they re intelligent makes them more likely to cheat to win a game In the first study published September in Psychological Science year olds and year olds played a card guessing game An experimenter hid a card behind a barrier and the children had to guess whether the card s number was greater or less than six In some early rounds of the game a researcher told some of the children You are so smart Others were told You did very well this time Still others weren t praised at all Just before the kids guessed the final card in the game the experimenter left the room but not before reminding the children not to peek A video camera monitored the kids as they sat alone The children who had been praised for being smart were more likely to peek either by walking around or leaning over the barrier than the children in the other two groups the researchers found Among year olds who had been praised for their ability You did very well this time or not praised at all about percent cheated But the share of cheaters jumped to about percent among the year olds who had been praised as smart Similar but slightly lower numbers were seen for the year olds In another paper published July in Developmental Science the same group of researchers tested whether having a reputation for smarts would have an effect on cheating At the beginning of a similar card game played with and year old Chinese children researchers told some of the kids that they had a reputation for being smart Other kids were told they had a reputation for cleanliness while a third group was told nothing about their reputation The same phenomenon emerged Kids told they had a reputation for smarts were more likely than the other children to peek at the cards The kids who cheated probably felt more pressure to live up to their smart reputation and that pressure may promote winning at any cost says study coauthor Gail Heyman She s a psychologist at the University of California San Diego and a visiting professor at Zhejiang Normal University in Jinhua China Other issues might be at play too she says such as giving children a feeling of superiority that gives them a sense that they are above the rules Previous research has suggested that praising kids for their smarts can backfire in a different way It might sap their motivation and performance Heyman was surprised to see that children as young as shifted their behavior based on the researchers comments I didn t think it was worth testing children this age who have such a vague understanding of what it means to be smart she says But even in these young children words seemed to have a powerful effect The results and other similar work suggest that parents might want to curb the impulse to tell their children how smart they are Instead Heyman suggests keep praise specific You did a nice job on the project or I like the solution you came up with Likewise comments that focus on the process are good choices How did you figure that out and Isn t it fun to struggle with a hard problem like that It s unrealistic to expect parents and everyone else who comes into contact with children to always come up with the right compliment But I do think it s worth paying attention to the way we talk with our kids and what we want them to learn about themselves These studies have been a good reminder for me that comments made to my kids by anyone matter perhaps more than I know For some poison dart frogs gaining resistance to one of their own toxins came with a price The genetic change that gives one group of frogs immunity to a particularly lethal toxin also disrupts a key chemical messenger in the brain But the frogs have managed to sidestep the potentially damaging side effect through other genetic tweaks researchers report in the Sept Science While other studies have identified genetic changes that give frogs resistance to particular toxins this study lets you look under the hood to see the full effects of those changes and how the frogs are compensating says Butch Brodie an evolutionary biologist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville who wasn t involved in the research Many poison dart frogs carry cocktails of toxic alkaloid molecules in their skin as a defense against predators SN Online These toxins picked up through the frogs diets vary by species Here researchers studied frogs that carry epibatidine a substance so poisonous that just a few millionths of a gram can kill a mouse Previous studies have shown that poisonous frogs have become resistant to the toxins the amphibians carry by messing with the proteins that these toxins bind to in the body Switching out certain protein building blocks or amino acids changes the shape of the protein which can prevent toxins from latching on But making that change could have unintended side effects too says study coauthor Rebecca Tarvin an evolutionary biologist at the University of Texas at Austin For example the toxin epibatidine binds to proteins that are usually targeted by acetylcholine a chemical messenger that s necessary for normal brain function So Tarvin and her colleagues looked at how this acetylcholine receptor protein differed between poison frog species that are resistant to epibatidine and some of their close relatives that aren t Identifying differences between the frogs in the receptor protein s amino acids allowed researchers to systematically test the effects of each change To do so the scientists put the genetic instructions for the same protein in humans who aren t resistant to epibatidine into frog eggs The researchers then replaced select amino acids in the human code with different poison frog substitutions to find an amino acid switch that would make the resulting receptor protein resistant to epibatidine But epibatidine resistance wasn t a straightforward deal it turned out We noticed that replacing one of those amino acids in the human protein made it resistant to epibatidine but also affected its interaction with acetylcholine says study coauthor Cecilia Borghese a neuropharmacologist also at the University of Texas at Austin Both are binding in the exact same region of the protein It s a very delicate situation That is the amino acid change that made the receptor protein resistant to epibatidine also made it harder for acetylcholine to attach potentially impeding the chemical messenger s ability to do its job But the frogs themselves don t seem impaired That s because other amino acid replacements elsewhere in the receptor protein appear to have compensated Borghese and Tarvin found creating a protein that won t let the toxin latch on but that still responds normally to acetylcholine The resistance giving amino acid change appears to have evolved three separate times in poison frogs Tarvin says Three different lineages of the frogs have resistance to the poison and all of them got that immunity by flipping the same switch But the amino acid changes that bring back a normal acetylcholine response aren t the same across those three groups It s a cool convergence that these other switches weren t identical but they all seem to recover that function Brodie says A genetic risk factor for Alzheimer s disease is a double make that triple whammy In addition to speeding up the development of brain plaques associated with Alzheimer s a gene variant known as APOE also makes tau tangles another signature of the disease worse researchers report online September in Nature APOE protein also ramps up brain inflammation that kills brain cells neuroscientist David Holtzman of Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis and colleagues have discovered This paper is a tour de force says Robert Vassar a neuroscientist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago It s a seminal study that s going to be a landmark in the field of Alzheimer s research Vassar predicts For more than years researchers have known that people who carry the E version of the APOE gene are at increased risk of developing Alzheimer s A version of the gene called APOE has no effect on Alzheimer s risk whereas the APOE version protects against the disease Molecular details for how APOE protein which helps clear cholesterol from the body affects brain cells are not understood But Holtzman and other researchers previously demonstrated that plaques of amyloid beta protein build up faster in the brains of APOE carriers SN p Having A beta plaques isn t enough to cause the disease Holtzman says Tangles of another protein called tau are also required Once tau tangles accumulate brain cells begin to die and people develop dementia In a series of new experiments Holtzman and colleagues now show for the first time that there s also a link between APOE and tau tangles In one experiment mice that had no A beta in their brains developed more tau tangles if they carried the human version of APOE than if they had the human APOE gene Holtzman and colleagues found That finding indicates APOE affects tau independently of A beta Brains of people who died from various diseases caused by tangled tau had more dead and damaged cells if the people carried APOE The researchers also tracked people who had low levels of A beta in their cerebral spinal fluid a clue that plaques have formed in the brain and who showed symptoms of Alzheimer s Over a five to year period the disease progressed percent faster in people with one copy of APOE and percent faster in people with two copies than in people who didn t have that version of the gene the researchers found Those worsening symptoms are presumed to be caused by more rapid buildup of tau tangles in the APOE carriers APOE also seems to make Alzheimer s worse by causing inflammation the researchers found Two kinds of mouse glial brain cells microglia and astrocytes making different versions of the APOE protein were grown with brain nerve cells or neurons that make disease causing forms of tau Mouse neurons grown with glia making no APOE grew well even though they were making abnormal tau But neurons grown with glia making APOE often died APOE provoked inflammation responses in the normally friendly astrocytes and microglia leading those cells to kill neurons the researchers found Such inflammation can make brain degeneration worse The data linking the APOE gene to tau tangles and brain inflammation is super tight says molecular neurobiologist Sangram Sisodia of the University of Chicago But the molecular details behind how APOE protein causes those effects are still vexingly absent he says Much more work is needed to uncover which molecules APOE interacts with so that researchers can devise ways to counteract its negative effects in the brain Any therapies that decrease or eliminate APOE will need to be limited to the brain because the protein is needed in the rest of the body to maintain healthy cholesterol levels Vassar says You don t want to give a person heart disease to cure Alzheimer s disease No one knows whether chronic marijuana smoking causes emotional troubles or is a symptom of them This dearth of evidence has a number of explanations serious lingering reactions if they exist occur after prolonged use rarely after a single dose marijuana has no known medical use unlike LSD so scientists have had little reason to study the drug Also marijuana has been under strict legal sanctions for more than years Science News October Update In states and in Washington D C marijuana is now commonly prescribed for post traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain But the drug s pros and cons remain hazy Regular pot use has been linked to psychotic disorders and to alcohol and drug addiction SN Online And two recent research reviews conclude that very little high quality data exist on whether marijuana effectively treats PTSD or pain Several large scale trials are under way to assess how well cannabis treats these conditions Marijuana s medical promise deserves closer better funded scientific scrutiny a new state of the science report concludes The report released January by the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine in Washington D C calls for expanding research on potential medical applications of cannabis and its products including marijuana and chemical components called cannabinoids Big gaps in knowledge remain about health effects of cannabis use for good or ill Efforts to study these effects are hampered by federal classification of cannabis as a Schedule drug meaning it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse Schedule status makes it difficult for researchers to access cannabis The new report recommends reclassifying the substance to make it easier to study Recommendations from the member committee that authored the report come at a time of heightened acceptance of marijuana and related substances Cannabis is a legal medical treatment in states and the District of Columbia Recreational pot use is legal in eight of those states and the District The legalization and commercialization of cannabis has allowed marketing to get ahead of science says Raul Gonzalez a psychologist at Florida International University in Miami who reviewed the report before publication While the report highlights possible medical benefits Gonzalez notes that it also underscores negative consequences of regular cannabis use These include certain respiratory and psychological problems A survey indicated that around million people in the United States ages and older ingested some form of cannabis in the last month mainly as a recreational drug Roughly percent of those people reported using cannabis solely for medical reasons and percent reported a mix of recreational and medical use This growing acceptance accessibility and use of cannabis and its derivatives have raised important public health concerns says committee chair Marie McCormick a Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health pediatrician She and her committee colleagues considered more than abstracts of studies on cannabis s health effects published between January and August The committee gave special weight to research reviews published since Cannabis and cannabinoids show medical potential the report concludes Evidence indicates that these substances substantially reduce chronic pain in adults Cannabis derivatives ingested in pills by multiple sclerosis patients temporarily reduce self reported muscle spasms SN p Cannabinoids also help to prevent and lessen chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in adults Less conclusive evidence suggests cannabis and cannabinoids improve sleep for adults with sleep apnea fibromyalgia chronic pain and multiple sclerosis the report says If cannabis was to be classified as a medicine then it needs to be rigorously tested like all other medicines says pharmacologist Karen Wright of Lancaster University in England She hopes the new report spurs researchers to develop standards for the chemical composition of cannabis products tested as possible medical treatments Despite cannabis s medical promise scientists have more questions than answers about how its use influences physical and mental health Encouragingly studies reviewed by the committee suggest that smoking marijuana unlike smoking cigarettes does not increase the chances of developing lung head and neck cancers But pot s relationship to other cancers as well as to heart attacks strokes and diabetes is unclear And few or no findings support the use of cannabis to treat Tourette s syndrome post traumatic stress disorder cancer epilepsy SN Online or other medical ailments Evidence does not conclusively link marijuana smoking to respiratory diseases such as asthma But regular pot use tends to accompany increased chronic bronchitis episodes and an intensified cough and phlegm production at least until smoking stops Cannabis smoke may deter infection related inflammation in the body But data are sparse on whether cannabis or its derivatives influence immune responses in healthy people or those with HIV There are some clear downsides to consuming marijuana and related substances the new report adds Solid scientific support exists for a link between cannabis use and later development of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia A moderate relationship exists between cannabis use and the development of addictions to alcohol tobacco and illegal drugs Fairly strong evidence points to learning memory and attention problems immediately after smoking marijuana Limited data however tie pot use to academic problems dropping out of school unemployment or lowered income in adulthood Plate tectonics may have gotten a pretty early start in Earth s history Most estimates put the onset of when the large plates that make up the planet s outer crust began shifting at around billion years ago But a new study in the Sept Science that analyzes titanium in continental rocks asserts that plate tectonics began million years earlier Nicolas Greber now at the University of Geneva and colleagues suggest that previous studies got it wrong because researchers relied on chemical analyses of silicon dioxide in shales sedimentary rocks that bear the detritus of a variety of continental rocks These rocks silicon dioxide composition can give researchers an idea of when continental rocks began to diverge in makeup from oceanic rocks as a result of plate tectonics But weathering can wreak havoc on the chemical makeup of shales To get around that problem Greber s team turned to a new tool the ratios of two titanium isotopes forms of the same element that have different masses The proportion of titanium isotopes in the rocks is a useful stand in for the difference in silicon dioxide concentration between continental and oceanic rocks and isn t so easily altered by weathering Those data helped the team estimate that continental rocks and therefore plate tectonics were already going strong by billion years ago The largest study yet of the most energetic particles to slam into Earth provides the first solid clues to where the particles come from Using a giant array of tubs of water scientists found that these ultrahigh energy cosmic rays mostly originate outside the Milky Way An international team analyzed about years of data to show that particles with energies above billion billion electron volts generally come from a particular direction in the sky and it s not the galaxy s center The researchers report their findings in the Sept Science It s the first clear experimental indication that the sources of these high energy particles are located outside of our own galaxy probably somewhere in the nearby universe says Karl Heinz Kampert of the University of Wuppertal in Germany a spokesperson for the Pierre Auger Collaboration which made the discovery Cosmic rays are atomic nuclei that zip through space at the highest energies observed in nature Some unknown engine accelerates them to energies million times as high as that of protons in the Large Hadron Collider the largest particle accelerator on Earth SN p Previous hints suggested that cosmic rays could be boosted to such high speeds by violent phenomena such as starbursts SN p supernovas SN p and supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies possibly including the black hole in the middle of the Milky Way SN p But the charged particles are difficult to track back to their homes because magnetic fields in space scatter the rays like fog scatters light To overcome that uncertainty researchers need lots of particles It s a very hard problem to attack maybe the hardest problem in high energy astrophysics says astroparticle physicist Vasiliki Pavlidou of the University of Crete in Heraklion Greece who was not involved in the new work The Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina finds those particles using a collection of tubs of ultrapure water arranged over square kilometers That spread gives the observatory a better chance to detect the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays which are so rare that only one particle hits each square kilometer of Earth s atmosphere per year Luckily the tubs don t need to detect individual cosmic rays directly Instead the structures catch the cascade of particles cosmic rays produce when they slam into Earth s atmosphere called an air shower When the electrons protons muons and pions of the air shower run through the tubs of water the particles give off a little burst of light called Cherenkov radiation The speed direction and arrival time of that light can help identify where the original cosmic ray came from The observatory caught ultrahigh energy cosmic rays between January and August The team found that compared with the average density of particle strikes across the whole sky about percent fewer particles came from the center of the Milky Way Slightly more particles came from a direction about degrees away from the galactic center Intriguingly the excess points in the direction of the nearest cluster of galaxies to the Milky Way located between million and million light years from Earth That finding suggests cosmic rays are produced in some galaxies Kampert says just not ours Trying to identify which galaxies and seeing if there is any pattern linking them are the next steps That research could help narrow down the processes that can accelerate cosmic rays What we would like to understand is not only what kind of sources they are but also how these sources work Kampert says The new result is the most exciting thing that has happened in this field for a very long time Pavlidou says I definitely think the first experiment that will establish where these particles are coming from will get the Nobel Prize But it s very hard I think we have a decade still to go Some dinosaurs liked to cheat on their vegetarian diet Based on the shape of their teeth and jaws large plant eating dinosaurs are generally thought to have been exclusively herbivorous But for one group of dinosaurs roughly million year old poop tells another story Their fossilized droppings or coprolites contained tiny fragments of mollusk and other crustacean shells along with an abundance of rotten wood researchers report September in Scientific Reports Eating the crustaceans as well as the wood might have given the dinosaurs an extra dose of nutrients during breeding season to help form eggs and nourish the embryos Living herd animals do occasionally turn carnivore to fulfill a particular nutritional need says vertebrate paleontologist Paul Barrett of the Natural History Museum in London Sheep and cows are known to eat carcasses or bone when they have a deficiency in a mineral such as phosphorus or calcium or if they re pregnant or ill But the discovery that some plant eating dinos also ate crustaceans is the first example of this behavior in an extinct herbivore says Barrett who was not involved in the new study Ten years ago paleoecologist Karen Chin of the University of Colorado Boulder described finding large pieces of rotted wood in dino dung The coprolites were within a layer of rock in Montana known as the Two Medicine Formation dating to between million and million years ago That layer also contained numerous fossils of Maiasaura a type of large herbivorous duck billed dinosaur or hadrosaur SN p This year s Atlantic hurricane season has already proven to be active and deadly Powerful hurricanes such as Harvey Irma and Maria are also providing a testing ground for new tools that scientists hope will save lives by improving forecasts in various ways from narrowing a storm s future path to capturing swift changes in the intensity of storm winds Some of the tools that debuted this year such as the GOES satellite are already winning praise from scientists Others such as a new microsatellite system aiming to improve measurements of hurricane intensity and a highly anticipated new computer simulation that forecasts hurricane paths and intensities are still in the calibration phase As these tools get an unprecedented workout thanks to an unusually ferocious series of storms scientists may know in a few months whether hurricane forecasting is about to undergo a sea change The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s GOES satellite is perhaps the clearest success story of this hurricane season so far Public perceptions of hurricane forecasts tend to focus on uncertainty and conflicting predictions But in the big picture hurricane models adeptly forecasted Irma s ultimate path to the Florida Keys nearly a week before it arrived there says Brian Tang an atmospheric scientist at the University at Albany in New York I found that remarkable he says Ten or so years ago that wouldn t have been possible One reason for this is GOES which launched late last year and will become fully operational in November The satellite offers images at four times the resolution of previous satellites It s giving unparalleled details about the hurricanes Tang says including data on wind speeds and water temperatures delivered every minute that are then fed into models GOES s crystal clear images also give forecasters a better picture of the winds swirling around a storm s central eye But more data from this crucial region is needed to improve predictions of just how strong a hurricane might get Scientists continue to struggle to predict rapid changes in hurricane intensity Tang says He notes how Hurricane Harvey for example strengthened suddenly to become a Category storm right before it made landfall in Texas offering emergency managers little time to issue warnings That s the sort of thing that keeps forecasters up at night he says In December NASA launched a system of eight suitcase sized microsatellites called the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System or CYGNSS into orbit The satellites measure surface winds near the inner core of a hurricane such as between the eyewall and the most intense bands of rain at least a couple of times a day Those regions have previously been invisible to satellites measured only by hurricane hunter airplanes darting through the storm Improving forecasts of rapid intensification like what occurred with Harvey on August is exactly what CYGNSS is intended to do says Christopher Ruf an atmospheric scientist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and the lead scientist for CYGNSS Results from CYGNSS measurements of both Harvey and Irma look very promising he says While the data are not being used to inform any forecasts this year the measurements are now being calibrated and compared with hurricane hunter flight data The team will give the first detailed results from the hurricane season at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December Meanwhile NOAA has also been testing a new hurricane forecast model this year The U S forecasting community is still somewhat reeling from its embarrassing showing during s Hurricane Sandy which the National Weather Service had predicted would go out to sea while a European meteorological center predicted correctly that it would squarely hit New York City In the wake of that event Congress authorized million to improve U S weather forecasting and in NOAA held a competition to select a new weather prediction tool to improve its forecasts The clear winner was an algorithm developed by Shian Jiann Lin and colleagues at NOAA s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton N J In May NOAA announced that it would test the new model this hurricane season running it alongside the more established operational models to see how it stacks up Known as FV short for Finite Volume Cubed Sphere Dynamical Core the model divides the atmosphere into a D grid of boxes and simulates climate conditions within the boxes which may be as large as kilometers across or as small as kilometer across Unlike existing models FV can also re create vertical air currents that move between boxes such as the updrafts that are a key element of hurricanes as well as tornadoes and thunderstorms But FV s performance so far this year hasn t been a slam dunk FV did a far better job at simulating the intensity of Harvey than the other two leading models but it lagged behind the European model in determining the hurricane s path Lin says As for Irma the European model outperformed the others on both counts Still Lin says he is confident that FV is on the right track in terms of its improvement That s good because pressure to work out the kinks may ramp up rapidly Although NOAA originally stated that FV would be operational in I hear some hints that it could be next year he says Lin adds that a good model alone isn t enough to get a successful forecast the data that go into a model are ultimately crucial to its success In our discipline we call that garbage in garbage out he says With GOES and CYGNSS nearly online scientists are looking forward to even better hurricane models thanks to even better data A new species of hermit crab discovered in the shallow waters of southern Japan has been enjoying the perks of living like a peanut worm Like the worms the to millimeter long hermit crab uses corals as a covering researchers report September in PLOS ONE Other kinds of hermit crabs live in coral reefs but typically move in and out of a series of mollusk shells as the crabs grow Diogenes heteropsammicola is the first hermit crab known to form a mutually beneficial relationship with two species of mobile corals called walking corals Unlike more familiar coral species these walking corals don t grow in colonies and aren t attached to the seafloor Instead each host coral grows with and around a crab forming a cavity in the coral skeleton that provides a permanent home for the crustacean In exchange the crab helps the coral walk Walking corals are already known to be in a symbiotic relationship with a different sea creature flexible marine peanut worms called sipunculids A symbiotic shift between such distantly related species as the worms and the crab is rare because organisms in a mutualistic relationship tend to be specialized and completely dependent on one other says study coauthor Momoko Igawa an ecologist at Kyoto University in Japan But similar to the worms D heteropsammicola appears to be well adapted to live in the corals Its extra slim body can slip inside the corals narrow cavity And unlike other hermit crabs whose tails curve to the right to fit into spiral shells D heteropsammicola s tail is symmetrical and can curl either way just like the corals opening Being able to walk around in something that is going to grow larger as you grow larger that s a big plus says Jan Pechenik a biologist at Tufts University in Medford Mass who was not involved in the study A typical hermit crab that can t find a larger shell to move into really is in trouble D heteropsammicola s relationship with walking corals may begin in a similar way as it does with sipunculan worms Igawa says A walking coral larva latches onto a tiny mollusk shell containing a juvenile hermit crab and starts to grow When the hermit crab outgrows the shell the crustacean moves into the readily available host coral s crevice and the shell remains encapsulated in the coral By observing the hermit crab in an aquarium Igawa and coauthor Makoto Kato also an ecologist at Kyoto University determined that the crab provides the corals with the same services as the worms transportation and preventing the corals from being overturned by currents or buried in sediment Igawa hopes to search for this new hermit crab in Indonesia a region where walking corals are normally found Plus because walking coral fossils are easy to come by in Japan she also wants to reveal the evolutionary history of the symbioses of walking corals with sipunculans and hermit crabs by observing these fossils For certain HIV antibodies having a buddy or two makes a big difference in the fight against the virus Combining the antibodies called broadly neutralizing antibodies may stop more strains of HIV than any single one can do alone two new studies suggest A triple threat antibody molecule can bind to three different spots on the virus researchers report online September in Science In Science Translational Medicine a second team describes a cocktail of two single antibodies that each target a different region of the virus Both methods prevented infection from multiple strains of an HIV like virus in monkeys We have known for many years that broadly neutralizing antibodies are extremely powerful antibodies says molecular biologist Nancy Haigwood of the Oregon Health Science University in Portland who was not involved in either study Using more than one of these antibodies is the most promising approach to block HIV infection in humans because it offers more coverage she says This extra coverage is needed because HIV is a master of mutation It s really adopted every bit of what I would call molecular trickery to outwit our immune system and it s a constant battle says Gary Nabel coauthor of the study in Science and chief scientific officer of Sanofi in Cambridge Mass The immune system keeps trying to recognize parts of the virus but mutations in the virus can alter those sites You really want to have this broadside attack against the virus that hits multiple targets he says Broadly neutralizing antibodies are powerful because they can bind to multiple strains of HIV SN p The antibodies stop HIV from getting into cells to infect them Still there is no single antibody that can block all strains says virologist Dan Barouch of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston Barouch and colleagues tackled the issue by mixing two of the antibodies together The researchers divided rhesus monkeys into four groups giving one group the cocktail two groups the individual antibodies and one group a saline solution with no antibodies A day later all of the monkeys were exposed to a mix of two simian human immunodeficiency virus or SHIV strains The outer protein that surrounds HIV where antibodies bind is the same in SHIV None of the five animals that received the antibody cocktail became infected while all of the other animals did the researchers report in Science Translational Medicine Nabel and colleagues took a different tack They developed a molecule that combines the binding talents of three antibodies into one The researchers tested their tri specific antibody in rhesus monkeys giving eight animals the trio antibody while two other groups each received just one of the broadly neutralizing antibodies that inspired the molecule The animals were exposed to a mix of SHIV strains five days later Of the monkeys in the solo antibody groups developed infections None of the eight animals dosed with the trio antibody did Both teams antibody approaches show impressive protection against a combination of viruses suggesting that they would be effective against diverse HIV strains in humans Haigwood says Virologist David Margolis of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill notes that the approaches are most likely to have preventative potential but they also may be therapeutic The antibody combinations might replace oral antiretroviral therapy or stand in for oral therapy in medical situations where pills cannot be taken he says The next step for both methods is to test the combination antibodies in people the authors say Whether the strategy is most effective as a preventative measure treatment or both the papers suggest that to achieve optimal protection in humans multiple antibodies or antibody targets are going to be needed Barouch says For the first time researchers have disabled a gene in human embryos to learn about its function Using molecular scissors called CRISPR Cas researchers made crippling cuts in the OCT gene Kathy Niakan and colleagues report September in Nature The edits revealed a surprising role for the gene in the development of the placenta Researchers commonly delete and disable genes in mice fruit flies yeast and other laboratory critters to investigate the genes normal roles but have never done this before in human embryos Last year government regulators in the United Kingdom gave permission for Niakan a developmental biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in London and colleagues to perform gene editing on human embryos left over from in vitro fertilization treatments SN Online The researchers spent nearly a year optimizing techniques in mouse embryos and human stem cells before conducting human embryo experiments Niakan says This groundbreaking research allows researchers to directly study human development genes says developmental biologist Dieter Egli of Columbia University This is unheard of It s not something that has been possible he says What we know about human development is largely inferred from studies of mice frogs and other model organisms Other researchers have used CRISPR Cas to repair mutated genes in human embryos SN p SN p The eventual aim of that research is to prevent genetic diseases but it has led to concerns that the technology could be abused to produce designer babies who are better looking smarter and more athletic than they otherwise would be There s nothing irresponsible about the research in this case says stem cell researcher Paul Knoepfler of the University of California Davis School of Medicine The researchers focused on basic questions about how one gene affects human embryo development Such studies may one day lead to better fertility treatments but the more immediate goal is to gain better insights into human biology Niakan s group focused on a gene called OCT also known as POU F a master regulator of gene activity which is important in mouse embryo development This gene is also known to help human embryonic stem cells stay flexible enough to become any type of body cell a property known as pluripotency Scientists use OCT protein to reprogram adult cells into embryonic like cells an indication that it is involved in early development SN p But researchers didn t know precisely how the OCT gene operates during human development Niakan already had clues that it works at slightly different times in human embryos than it does in mice SN p In the experiment human embryos lacking OCT had difficulty reaching the blastocyst stage Only percent of edited embryos formed blastocysts while percent of unedited embryos did Blastocysts are balls of about cells that form about five or six days after fertilization The ball s outer layer of cells gives rise to the placenta Inside the blastocyst one type of embryonic stem cells will become the yolk sac Another kind about cells known as epiblast progenitor cells will give rise to all the cells in the body Niakan and colleagues predicted from earlier work with mice and human embryonic stem cells that the protein OCT would be necessary for the epiblast cells to develop correctly As predicted knocking out the OCT gene disrupted epiblasts development What the researchers didn t expect is that OCT also affects the development of the placenta precursor cells on the outside of the blastocyst That s not predicted anywhere in the literature Niakan says We ll be spending quite a lot of time on this in the future to uncover exactly what this role might be When Donald Griffin and Robert Galambos first reported that bats use the ricocheting echoes of sound waves to pilot through the environment some scientists doubted it was possible The team s experiments conducted in the late s at Harvard University and reported in the early s coincided with World War II and the proliferation of active sonar systems for use on ships and submarines The notion that bats might do anything even remotely analogous to the latest triumphs of electronic engineering struck most people as not only implausible but emotionally repugnant Griffin later said But Griffin disagreed In in an issue of Science he proposed the term echolocation to cover not only locating obstacles by means of echoes in bats but also by people including via radar fathometers and submarines using apparatus working on the same basic principles The word echolocation didn t replace existing technical terms in fact it s sometimes called biosonar but the scientific community quickly came around Today a lot of neuroscientists have a deep respect for bats impressive abilities and some are studying how bat brains process the signals necessary for navigating as freelance writer Amber Dance reports These insights might lead to improvements to sonar as well as new bat inspired technologies It makes sense Humans have been perfecting sonar for more than a century but evolution has been honing echolocation for much much longer The same is true for sticky goo Slugs mussels and other critters release slimy secretions as part of normal life Researchers are turning to these critters to design adhesives that perform well in the human body as covered by Laurel Hamers Science News often reports on how nature inspires science and technology There are robots that grow like plants SN Online and grippers modeled on gecko feet SN Online those stories include video Materials scientists interested in building better bridges are taking cues from bone SN p And the great variety of wild yeasts inspires brewers to experiment with new flavors of beer That s applying nature s know how for practical and pleasurable purposes But not all of nature s lessons go down as smoothly as a cold pint Over the last several decades humankind has learned that we can t dump pollution into our skies or seas or soils without some serious consequences Though the air may be cleaner today than half a decade ago exhaust from vehicles and industrial emissions still pose public health risks that might even extend beyond the lungs as Laura Beil reports And though it s hard to say for sure how climate change has contributed to recent destructive hurricanes there s no doubt that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide thanks largely to human activities are altering our planet and threatening our futures How as a society will we respond Will we be inspired to take the kind of action that leads to long term change It s easy to hold off to claim change is too hard and to become discouraged When we lose heart we need only look to the bats As Helen Thompson reports even these exquisitely adapted fliers will face plant now and then Ninad Kothari s workplace looks like something out of a sci fi film The graduate student at Johns Hopkins University works in a darkened red lit room where he trains bats to fly through obstacle courses Shielding within the walls keeps radio and other human made signals from interfering with transmissions from the tiny electrical signals he s recording from the bats brains as the animals bob and weave Layers of foam further insulate the cavelike lab against sound waves An array of cameras and microphones complete the futuristic scene The high tech setup has its homemade touches too In one obstacle course bats dodge dangling Quaker oatmeal cylinders Kothari is part of a small cadre of neuroscientists who are getting the best sense yet of how bat brains work at a cellular level thanks to modern technologies Eavesdropping tools which rely on tiny probes that track the activities of individual nerve cells or neurons are now miniaturized enough to outfit bats with head mounted wireless sensors As the animals fly freely around the lab the researchers can listen in on neurons By allowing the bats to behave naturally unencumbered by bulky equipment scientists will discover exciting new facets of how bat brains work says neuroscientist Nachum Ulanovsky of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot Israel who invented the new wireless sensors with colleagues He and others studying several different species of bats are investigating how the flying mammals perceive their environment and navigate through it The go to lab animals for studying how the mammalian brain maps and navigates its surroundings are mice and rats But bat researchers say their animal of choice offers distinct advantages For one rodent navigation studies are mostly limited to fairly basic environments in the lab such as mazes Those setups are too simple to tell much about how the system operates in complex environments in the real world says Edvard Moser of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim Moser shared a Nobel Prize for discovering place cells in the rodent brain SN Online Place cells help the animal identify its location in a mental map of the environment Since bats fly scientists can more easily investigate how bat brains deal with space in three dimensions Researchers are already reporting on new types of neurons not yet observed in rodents or other animals Moser expects that rodent and human brains may map and navigate spaces in a manner similar to bats scientists have already seen striking parallels between rat and bat brains he says Bats are also interesting to scientists because bat brains must switch between several kinds of input to make sense of the world Like people they use their ears and eyes contrary to popular myth no bat species is entirely blind though some rely on vision more than others On top of that most bats also use echolocation to sense their surroundings While flying an echolocating bat produces calls that bounce off objects such as trees to avoid or insects to chase then return to the bat as echoes With their supersensitive ears and their finely tuned brains bats use this information to determine where things are The echolocation calls are typically beyond the range of human hearing which is good because the calls are quite loud about decibels or so says Khaleel A Razak a neuroscientist at the University of California Riverside He likens the volume to what a person would experience standing next to a pounding jackhammer By tracking the routes bats fly as well as their calls and the echoes they pick up bat brain aficionados are starting to match behavior with brain activity In some of the most recent studies scientists have begun to figure out how bats pinpoint the locations of the sounds of prey and map and navigate the greater world The researchers may have a thing or two to teach sonar engineers Going natural To understand bats brain activity at the level of individual neurons researchers implant tiny wires The aim is to read when individual neurons fire that is when one brain cell generates an electrical signal to send along to other cells in the brain or body Exactly what these neurons are communicating remains hazy but they might for example tell another part of the brain that there s a sound coming in from the right or left The hippocampus is where Ulanovsky focuses This deep brain structure involved in learning and memory is a place where bats make and store maps of their surroundings Usually neuroscientists have to tether an animal to a bulky data recorder with wires but Ulanovsky wants his bats to fly He and colleagues designed a lightweight miniature data logger small enough to mount atop a bat s head The recorder which connects to the tiny implanted wires wirelessly transmits its readings to Ulanovsky s computer This allows us to get closer to the natural behavior he says Ulanovsky asks how the firing patterns of neurons match up with the free flying bats actions In a handful of papers published since he and colleagues have identified key types of navigational neurons that scientists had also seen in rats like place cells that fire when a bat is in a particular spot Another type of cell called grid cells seems to work via an imaginary mental grid the brain lays over the real environment SN Online These cells activate when a bat crosses the grid lines Other neurons turn on when a bat s head is at a particular angle We found them all in bats just like in rodents Ulanovsky says Those findings though satisfying told only half the story he says how a bat understands where it is at any given time But what if the bat has a goal destination in mind too We had an understanding of how point A is represented but not point B he says It has been a big missing link In experiments reported in January in Science Ulanovsky s team identified hippocampal neurons responsible for keeping track of target destinations in Egyptian fruit bats Rousettus aegyptiacus pointy eared critters with doglike faces that use echolocation to find tasty fruits and nectar The researchers trained the bats to fly around a room to a banana reward which was sometimes hidden behind a curtain In one experiment the team placed wire probes in the hippocampus of three bats eavesdropping on a total of neurons in the vicinity of the electrodes Of those fired when a bat was at certain angles to its goal and fired when it was certain distances from its goal Twenty four of the neurons responded to both angle and distance With input from those three types of neurons the bat s brain kept track of the location of the treat It s an exciting and important study says Hugo Spiers a neuroscientist at University College London who studies navigation in people and rats How cells in the hippocampus might provide guidance signals has been very underinvestigated Spiers is now looking for similar goal directed neurons in rats People probably have neurons similar to those reported by Ulanovsky Spiers adds Actions and reactions Before starting his group at the Weizmann Institute Ulanovsky learned about bats in the lab of Cynthia Moss now Kothari s adviser at Johns Hopkins Moss focuses on an area on the surface of the brain the midbrain superior colliculus Like the hippocampus the superior colliculus also maps a bat s environment but there s a difference The hippocampus makes a map of environmental features with respect to each other no matter where the bat is it keeps the same basic mental map The superior colliculus generates a map of the world with the bat at the center so the map changes as the animal moves The superior colliculus links what an animal perceives with how it moves in response In an eyesight favoring animal like a human that might mean turning the head or shifting gaze to get a better look at the sudden movement of an oncoming car or a zooming baseball For bats one role of the superior colliculus is to help the bat orient itself to sounds such as the echoes of its own calls Most studies of animal sensory processing including Moss past work involve restrained animals Studies might also use speakers emitting calls and echoes to create a sort of virtual reality for bats instead of using their natural calls and echoes Moss notes For more than a decade she s been working toward the experiments Kothari and postdoctoral researcher Melville Wohlgemuth recently performed in her high tech bat room Moss group is among the first to look at how neurons in the superior colliculus respond to the auditory world in three dimensions while an animal is freely moving Moss and her team study big brown bats Eptesicus fuscus which in fact are not very big Moss says They re a bit smaller than the average hamster though their wingspan is a foot long In the wild these bats nosh on beetles and other small insects Measuring the precise distance to an insect meal with both predator and prey aloft is a crucial life skill As the bats flew their oatmeal container obstacle course and another that required them to find a hole in a net Kothari and Wohlgemuth recorded neuron activity with sensors similar to Ulanovsky s But to match specific neurons with what the bats were doing and perceiving the scientists needed to know what calls the animals produced and what echoes the animals heard That s where the microphones around the room come in The researchers took advantage of the fact that echolocation is a back and forth between a bat and its world The bat can tune the direction and rate of its calls depending on what it s investigating So the scientists eavesdropping with ultrasonic microphones can infer what the bats are homing in on as if the animals are broadcasting for example I m focusing in on this yummy mealworm on my right Then the researchers used computer software to predict what echoes would come back to the bat Putting mikes on the bats heads would be too heavy for the lightweight fliers and probably not sensitive enough to pick up those echoes anyway Moss and colleagues predicted that certain neurons would respond to the angle an echo returned from as well as to the time delay which indicates the distance of the sound reflecting object Indeed of neurons the researchers managed to monitor from two big brown bats fired in response to an echo returning at particular angles and distances from the animal Those neurons were helping the bats localize objects in three dimensional space During their flights the bats sometimes sent out sonar sound groups rapid clusters of echolocation calls Moss had hypothesized that these clusters help bats get better spatial resolution to really focus on the objects of greatest interest That s important for instance when navigating a dense forest or cluttered room The new study not yet published supports the idea The bats seem to use the clusters to narrow interest to objects a certain distance away which the bats can measure by the time delay between their call and the returning echo The farther away something is the longer the delay When the bats were just doing normal nonclustered echolocation a given neuron that fires for an eight millisecond echo delay would also respond to a range of echo times say any time between four and milliseconds Moss explains But when the bats emitted clustered calls the same neuron would respond only to echoes coming in at a delay close to eight milliseconds The bats were fine tuning their brains so they could get a better sharper impression of the most interesting objects she says The value of the study lies in the observations in untethered animals says Shihab Shamma a neuroscientist and engineer at the University of Maryland in College Park who studies sound processing in ferrets This one is more natural he says That s really cool to actually see what the processing is in the brain Shamma says Because the circuitry of the superior colliculus is common across mammals Kothari predicts that similar D processing of space occurs in humans and other primates too From all directions These latest findings with untethered bats broaden understanding of how animals navigate But the researchers are well aware that each study focuses on only a small part of a larger process For example what happens after a navigation related neuron in the superior colliculus or hippocampus fires How does the brain turn neuron firing into a map of its world or a decision to move from here to there Very little is known Ulanovsky says Razak at UC Riverside has an idea about how the firing of certain neurons gets interpreted though it s only a hypothesis He studies echolocation as well as direct listening for environmental sounds in a group of bat species called gleaning bats They re also called whispering bats because they emit quiet echolocation calls as they fly along ears cocked for the rustles of insect prey on the ground Specifically Razak works with gleaners known as pallid bats Antrozous pallidus because of their white bellies which Razak suspects might offer camouflage from the gaze of insects looking upward Pallid bats are remarkably good at pinpointing the location of a sound with an accuracy of to degrees Razak says Humans appear to be better at this task able to tell the difference between sounds separated by just to degrees But we have the advantage of several inches between our two ears making it easier to triangulate the source of sound If you normalize to head size the bat is a champion Razak says He studies the auditory cortex an outer part of the brain involved in hearing and interpreting sounds In his previous research Razak reported how certain cortex neurons in anesthetized bats respond to sounds coming in from different angles in a horizontal semicircle in front of the animal In a report in the Journal of Neuroscience he started to explain how bats determine the vertical angle to dinner There are two overlapping maps in the cortex one for horizontal and one for vertical angles For the horizontal angle one group of neurons fires when a sound comes in from directly in front of the bat s nose Other groups respond to sounds to the left or the right of the animal The auditory cortex on the right side of the brain responds to sounds in what Razak refers to as the left hemifield anywhere to the left side of the head The more right brain neurons are firing the more directly to the left the sound is The same thing happens on the left side of the bat s brain for sounds on the right A second map indicates the vertical angle A few neurons fire for sounds that are coming in low and more fire for sounds coming in from a higher elevation To decode those signals Razak hypothesizes there could be some as yet undefined comparer that integrates the information from the two maps If the comparer is getting mostly straight ahead signals it knows the sound is coming from dead in front of the bat s nose If it s getting mostly right hemifield signals from the left side of the brain it can deduce that the sound is coming from somewhere to the right side of the head at a range of horizontal or vertical angles to the ear If it s hearing a lot of that input from the right side of the brain then the sound is on the left This theory is the first idea proposed for how the auditory cortex of any animal understands the location of an object at both horizontal and vertical angles Razak says He s now designing experiments to test this idea and search for the comparer Taken together these studies are beginning to paint a picture of what goes on in the brain as a bat perceives and moves through its environment But there s still plenty of uncertainty about the bat brain and how well it matches to what the human brain does These are still big questions How do we make sounds and how does our brain control what we make How do we develop the sense of localization says Razak The bats continue to offer some interesting insight What s already certain is that the flying creatures have earned the respect of the scientists working with them After all Moss notes the big brown bat s brain is the size of a lima bean but still manages to process sounds in a way human sonar engineers envy Bats with their superb ability to echolocate are inspiring advanced technologies from better Navy sonar to gadgets that might deliver packages or help farmers manage crops And engineers aren t waiting for neuroscientists to work out every detail of how the bats brains manage the task We think we have enough information to be useful to us to develop a bio inspired sensor says research engineer Jason Gaudette of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Newport Division in Rhode Island Like bats the Navy uses sonar to find and visualize objects in the deep But current versions are far less elegant than the flying mammals system The Navy s sonar arrays can be huge encompassing hundreds of ears that listen for sonar pings from atop a submarine s dome or trailing behind it in a long tail Bats Gaudette notes dodge obstacles and find mosquito sized meals with just two ears He and colleagues have developed a bat inspired prototype device that they hope can perform more like bats do Mounted on the nose of a half meter long torpedo shaped autonomous undersea robot the sonar system has one sound transmitter and three receivers Gaudette hopes to eventually get that number down to two or even one The system uses algorithms inspired by research in bats to interpret returning sonar echoes for navigation If it works the system could help the Navy perform sonar imaging using less space and less money while offering sharper images Gaudette says Researchers in Israel are hoping to help farmers with a bat inspired kind of sonar Neuroecologist Yossi Yovel of Tel Aviv University is creating computer algorithms describing how bats might interpret returning echoes to distinguish different plants Yovel collaborates with Avital Bechar a researcher at the Institute of Agricultural Engineering near Rishon LeZion Israel who wants to help farmers predict their crops yield which can vary widely from year to year The same acre of tomato plants for example could yield or tons of fruit Bechar estimates Such a wide range puts farmers at a disadvantage in negotiating a price for crops and forces the farmers to guess how much equipment and how many pickers they ll need at harvest time Bechar s sonar system which emits batlike sounds and records via microphones that mimic bat ears can penetrate three rows of plants deep farther than cameras could Then it calculates the number of leaves and pounds of fruit per plant based on Yovel s algorithms Bechar has mounted the scanner on a prototype robot and plans to affix it to a drone to count fruit in meter high date palms The researchers also hope to add weed detection capability Bechar expects it to be a game changer in agriculture because it will reduce the unknowns At Virginia Tech in Blacksburg engineer Rolf Mueller is learning tricks from the physical structures of bats noses and ears Certain bat groups such as horseshoe bats one species Mueller works with is Rhinolophus ferrumequinum send out their echolocation calls through their noses like a snort Complex fleshy formations called nose leaves change the outgoing sound as it comes out of the nose And the bats ears have more than muscles which rapidly change shape as the bat listens for echoes Mueller says That flexibility gives the animals more information he suspects It s like seeing the world with a different perspective at the same time from one echo His group developed a prototype robot with mechanical nose leaves and shape shifting ears and sent it zooming through forested areas on a zip line to record how the bot perceives trees and branches Eventually Mueller envisions an autonomous underwater bot or an airborne drone with a similar sonar setup The drone could be useful for delivering packages in forested or otherwise complicated areas without crashing Barn owl ears age well Unlike other animals the birds don t suffer from hearing loss as a hallmark of aging a new study suggests Beyond people age related hearing loss has been documented in mice gerbils and chinchillas Those deficits are linked to deterioration of the tiny hair cells that line the sensory layer of the eardrum But some evidence hints that birds may not suffer from dips in hearing Bianca Krumm and her colleagues at the University of Oldenburg in Germany tested the ear sensitivity of seven barn owls Tyto alba grouped by age There weren t significant differences in what year old owls could hear versus those age or older suggesting the birds ears remain intact despite age the researchers conclude September in Proceedings of the Royal Society B While the exact mechanism for this apparent ear agelessness remains elusive the researchers suspect that the birds must continuously regenerate sensory ear tissue a process that wanes with age in other species Craft brewers are going wild Some of the trendiest beers on the market are intentionally brewed with yeast scavenged from nature rather than the carefully cultivated ale or lager yeast used in most commercial beers Matthew Bochman is in on the action By day he s a biochemist at Indiana University Bloomington who studies how cells keep their DNA intact On the side he can be found bagging new kinds of wild yeast When Bochman a self professed yeast whisperer moved to Indiana he made friends with many local craft brewers including Robert Caputo Caputo wanted to make a beer that is percent Indiana He had state grown hops and malt grains and Indiana water is plentiful The missing ingredient was the Indiana yeast Bochman says Caputo asked Bochman to help find the missing microbes So we went yeast hunting Bochman says He collected about strains of yeast Whenever I was out and about I would grab something a piece of bark a berry bring it back to the lab and get yeast from it The microbes are everywhere he says It s hard not to find yeast But not just any yeast will do For beer brewing Bochman needed yeast that eats the sugar maltose in wort the liquid extracted from grain mash that gets fermented into beer Brewing yeast also has to be tolerant of hops which make weak acids that might slow yeast growth The yeast must be able to live in to percent alcohol And of course the microbes have to smell and taste at least neutral if not good Bochman says Not all yeasts pass the sniff test Eight strains of Saccharomyces paradoxus made beer that smelled and tasted of adhesive bandages Bochman and colleagues report online August at bioRxiv org But in a batch of wild beer brewed in an open vat in a vacant lot in Indianapolis by Bochman s friends at Black Acre Brewing Co yielded a winner Among the four species and six strains of yeast in the beer was a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain called YH S cerevisiae is a species of yeast used to brew ales and to make bread YH lends beer an aroma that is an amazing pineapple guava something Like an umbrella drink Bochman says He doesn t yet know what chemicals the yeast makes to produce the tropical fruit scent He puts his money on one of the sweet smelling esters yeast use to attract fruit flies SN p Sour beer brewers may also benefit from Bochman s bioprospecting Sour beers generally contain lactic acid bacteria in addition to yeast Brewers need separate equipment for brewing sour beer because it s difficult to get rid of all the bacteria when switching back to brewing other beers Among species of yeast Bochman and colleagues studied five strains can make both alcohol and lactic acid to brew sour beers without bacteria The researchers described the five sourpusses online July at bioRxiv org Bochman and Caputo formed the company Wild Pitch Yeast to sell these strains The company supplied yeast isolated from cobwebs trees and other spots to brewers making all Indiana beers dubbed Bicentenni ales for the state s th anniversary last year Bochman and Caputo are relying on brewers to tell them how the newfound yeasts perform in the real world The proof is in the brewing Bochman says You can do as many lab tests as you want but you re never going to know how something will act until you throw it into some wort and let it bubble away for a couple of weeks To the residents of Donora Pa a mill town in a crook of the Monongahela River the daily haze from nearby zinc and steel plants was the price of keeping their families fed But on October the city awoke to an unusually sooty sky even for Donora The next day the high school quarterbacks couldn t see their teammates well enough to complete a single pass The town was engulfed in smog for five days until a storm finally swept the pollution out of the valley By then more than one third of the population had fallen ill and people were dead Another perished in the following months After the Donora tragedy the federal government began to clamp down on industries that release pollutants into the air Environmental advocates in the coming decades fought for and won tighter regulations As a result combined emissions of six common air pollutants have dropped by about percent nationwide since the passage of the Clean Air Act which regulates U S emissions of hazardous air pollutants In major U S cities the total number of days with unhealthy air has fallen by almost two thirds just since It s one of the great success stories of public health says Joel Kaufman a physician and epidemiologist at the University of Washington School of Public Health in Seattle Our bodies feel the difference One study reported in JAMA last year followed children in Southern California between and to see how lung health correlated with three common air pollutants As levels of ozone nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter fell over time so did the number of children who reported a daily cough persistent congestion and other symptoms of irritated lungs At the start of the study percent of children with asthma had reported bronchitis symptoms in the previous year In communities with the greatest drop in pollutants during the study period bronchitis prevalence fell by as much as percent in children with asthma But the air pollution story isn t over Researchers from the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health in Boston recently reported on links between air quality and mortality throughout the entire U S Medicare population more than million people who are age and older or disabled The analysis looked at levels of two common air pollutants and death rates from to while accounting for factors that might confound the results such as race and socioeconomic status The analysis published in June in the New England Journal of Medicine found that when pollutant levels rose but remained at levels below national standards so did death rates Even with vast improvements in air quality since the s people haven t stopped dying from the air they breathe An analysis published in from researchers at MIT estimated that about premature deaths occur each year in the United States because of fine particulate air pollution A study published in January in Environmental Health Perspectives reported that daily deaths over a decade in metropolitan Boston peaked on days when concentrations of three common air pollutants were at their highest even though those levels would currently satisfy the U S Environmental Protection Agency We ve made these improvements in exposure Kaufman says but what more do we need to clean up So despite a half century of progress airborne grime is still a menace probably in ways the people of Donora never imagined Researchers are now finding that more than the lungs are at risk as dirty air may in fact be an accomplice to some of the greatest threats to public health including diabetes obesity and even dementia Those studies are likely to inform the ongoing debate over antismog rules The U S House of Representatives voted this summer to delay implementation of updated standards for the Clean Air Act Slow burn As it has for more than a century air pollution in America largely arises from power plants industries vehicles and other sources of fuel burning The pollution is generally a mixture of gases such as carbon monoxide sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides and particulate matter microscopic solids or droplets that can be inhaled into the lungs The pollutant that has declined the least is ozone a hard to control noxious gas formed when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds react with sunlight Ozone pollution tends to soar on hot windless summer days as the sun blazes Particulates come from tail pipes and smokestacks but also consist of tiny fragments shed from tires roads and brake pads Fine particulates less than micrometers wide or about a quarter of the width of the smallest grain of pollen are of greatest concern because they can penetrate deeply into the lungs to reach the body s innermost nooks and crannies A study in April in the journal ACS Nano demonstrated that fact Fourteen healthy volunteers intermittently riding exercise bikes inhaled gold nanoparticles stand ins for particulates and minutes later the nanoparticles were detected in the bloodstream and remained present in the body for as long as three months While events in Donora showed that air pollution can have immediate consequences it took decades for researchers to realize that deaths from smog could be going undetected lost in the background noise of mortality statistics In Harvard University scientists published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine looking at mortality rates among adults in six U S cities The researchers studied more than people for to years In areas with higher levels of sulfate particles in the air a measure of pollution mortality rates were higher Dozens of similar studies have followed including one published in that looked at death rates across of the largest U S cities That research found that the highest death rates occurred the day after particulate concentrations reached their highest levels though the levels were subtle enough to go unnoticed at the time Scientists now know that inhaling pollutants triggers a flurry of physiological coping mechanisms throughout the body Until years ago we thought that air pollution affected only the respiratory system says Petros Koutrakis an environmental chemist who heads the EPA Harvard Center for Ambient Particle Health Effects By the American Heart Association published a consensus statement in Circulation laying out a strong case that air pollution increases the risk of cardiovascular disease the leading cause of U S deaths More studies followed that statement including one from Kaufman and colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine in The researchers studied women looking for a link between exposure to fine particulates and death from heart attack or stroke or even nonfatal heart attacks or the need for artery clearing procedures In the end each increase of micrograms of fine particulates per cubic meter of air increased the risk of any cardiovascular health event by percent and the risk of dying from heart attack or stroke by percent In the American Heart Association updated its position The overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between fine particulate exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality While the mechanism is still under study research points to inflammation heart rate variability and blood vessel damage Evidence keeps accumulating A study by Koutrakis and colleagues published in in Archives of Internal Medicine found similar results When particulate concentrations rose even to mild levels those classified as a moderate health concern for a very small number of people by EPA standards the risk of stroke rose by percent within a day of exposure Pounds and pollution Lately studies have moved from cardiovascular disease into more unexpected territory And they ve turned up compelling evidence that air quality may contribute to excess body weight Frank Gilliland an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles became intrigued when laboratory studies suggested that certain pollutants in the environment might function as obesogens contributing to weight gain by mimicking or disrupting the action of hormones or having other effects Still he says I was very skeptical Out of curiosity he began to look for a link between childhood obesity and living close to a major roadway His first study published in examined over children across California Although the researchers found an association they couldn t rule out other explanations that would also lead back to cars Maybe the kids aren t getting exercise because there s a lot of traffic out he says Newer findings are more convincing including a study by Gilliland and colleagues They studied body mass index among children exposed to traffic related air pollution Of course as the children grew over the five year study period their BMIs increased from an average of to kilograms per square meter But children exposed to the most air pollution compared with those least exposed had a percent larger BMI increase which meant an additional kg m increase in BMI by age Adults too appear to be affected Researchers from Harvard Medical School and elsewhere published a study in in the journal Obesity looking at whether adults living with constant exposure to traffic are more likely to be overweight In particular people who lived within meters of a major road had a higher BMI by kg m and more fat tissue than those who lived meters from a busy road The healthy range for an adult s BMI is to kg m Studies in animals have started to offer hints why this might be the case Last year in the FASEB Journal Chinese researchers described an experiment in which one group of pregnant rats was raised in filtered air scrubbed of pollutants while another breathed the usual Beijinghaze Though they were fed the same diet the animals living in Beijing air were heavier at the end of their pregnancies as were their offspring that continued to breathe the dirty air eight weeks after birth Among later autopsy findings Rats exposed to pollution experienced higher levels of inflammation which is thought to be a contributor to weight gain and metabolic disruption The relationship is probably subtle and interwoven with genetics and lifestyle UCLA researchers who followed a large group of African American women over years found no association between weight and exposure to particulates For now the connection between obesity and pollution is still a subject of investigation But given that million Americans live along major roadways even a small effect could have widespread consequences Links to diabetes For many people diabetes goes hand in hand with obesity One of the earliest compelling studies to suggest a relationship between diabetes and air pollution was an animal experiment published in in Circulation from researchers at Ohio State University and other institutions The test was relatively simple Two groups of mice were fed a high fat diet for weeks One lived in clean filtered air the other group was housed in enclosures polluted with air containing fine particulates at concentrations still within EPA standards The mice breathed the polluted air for six hours per day five days a week for days Even though they ate the same food the mice living in dirty air developed metabolic changes characteristic of insulin resistance while the other mice did not Similarly a study from EPA scientists found that mice exposed to ozone can develop glucose intolerance a precursor for diabetes In July in Diabetes Gilliland and colleagues published data not only finding links between air pollution and diabetes in children but also insight into the body s physiological response In the study overweight or obese children in Los Angeles were followed for an average of three years At the end of the study children who lived in neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and particulates had experienced greater declines in insulin sensitivity and had signs of impaired pancreatic beta cells which produce insulin As for adults a study this year in Environment International conducted by researchers from eight institutions tracked more than African American women across the United States Those who were exposed to the highest concentrations of ozone were about percent more likely to develop diabetes even after adjusting for other possible explanations such as diet and exercise levels Brain drain One of the latest lines of research suggests that poisons in the air might accelerate aging in the brain Studies have long documented the connection between the nose and brain function For reasons not yet known for instance one of the early signs of Parkinson s disease is a loss of the ability to distinguish smells During her graduate studies at Harvard Jennifer Weuve now an epidemiologist at the Boston University School of Public Health wondered if airborne pollutants might be bad for the brain There was really intriguing data from animal studies she says which showed that inhaled pollutants had toxic effects on nerve cells In she published the first study to note a faster than normal cognitive decline among people exposed to higher levels of particulates both those smaller than micrometers and even larger ones that are thought to be less harmful Her study published in Archives of Internal Medicine analyzed data from the Nurses Health Study Cognitive Cohort which included almost women ages to and used geographic information and air monitoring data to estimate pollution exposure More recently researchers from Sweden examined the relationship between pollution exposure and dementia studying the records of people in northern Sweden participating in a long term study of memory and aging In in Environmental Health Perspectives the researchers reported that people with the most exposure to air pollution were also the most likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer s or other forms of dementia In all more than a dozen human studies have examined pollution s link to dementia Last year in NeuroToxicology Weuve and colleagues reviewed human studies published as of late and concluded that as a whole the evidence was highly suggestive and in need of more exploration What is it going to take for more people to take this seriously Weuve asks While the relationship is far from established animal data may help clarify the results One study published this year in Neurobiology of Aging from researchers at the University of Southern California examined brain changes in mice exposed to particulate air pollution at levels commonly found near freeways After exposure to the pollution for five hours per day three days a week for weeks the animals showed accelerated aging in the hippocampus a region of the brain associated with memory And a study of older women exposed to high levels of particulate matter at levels common in the eastern half of the United States and in parts of California showed a small decrease in the volume of white matter the myelin coated nerve cell projections called axons Parkinson s disease may also be linked to pollution Danish researchers with colleagues in the United States and Taiwan published a study last year in Environmental Health Perspectives looking at people with and without Parkinson s and their exposure to nitrogen dioxide a marker for traffic polluted air The scientists identified people in Denmark with Parkinson s diagnosed between and and compared them with about the same number of randomly selected healthy people Those exposed to the highest levels of air pollution had the greatest risk of developing the disease The data the researchers wrote raise concern given the increase in vulnerable aging populations If science bears out the connection between pollution and brain health or pollution and metabolism environmental advocates and businesses may have even more reason to push for cleaner air Researchers hope in the future to have more data on which pollutants cause the greatest harm and why In Donora the site of one of the country s biggest air pollution disasters a sign at the Smog Museum now reads Clean Air Started Here No one can yet say how clean is clean enough Microbes are pushing glacial snow into the red An alga species that grows on glaciers gives the snow a crimson hue which increases the amount of sunlight that the snow soaks up and makes it melt faster new measurements confirm On Alaska s Harding Icefield these microbes are responsible for about a sixth of the snowmelt in algae tinged areas researchers report September in Nature Geoscience The finding suggests that future climate simulations unlike current ones should account for the effects of these algae when making predictions about glacial melt The pink color sometimes called watermelon snow is caused by Chlamydomonas nivalis algae and related species C nivalis thrives in cold water and snowfields and glaciers are in some sense an aquatic environment says study coauthor Roman Dial a biologist at Alaska Pacific University in Anchorage Blooms pop up in the spring and summer but the algae can come back year after year Recent research has suggested that darkening of the snow by these algae or other microbes might make it melt faster That melt might spur even more algal growth starting a feedback loop of accelerated melting scientists have proposed But this is the first time algae s effect on snowmelt has been directly tested We used everything from microscopes to satellites Dial says Glaciers naturally contain small amounts of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus and higher levels of those nutrients might spur algal growth So Dial and colleagues added either extra water or nutrient rich fertilizer to different patches of snow on Harding Icefield a square kilometer frozen expanse in southern Alaska More water led to the growth of percent more algae compared with algal growth in untouched regions the team found Adding fertilizer quadrupled algal growth Then in new test sites the researchers added algae to some areas by dousing spots in fertilizer and removed algae from other sites using bleach Over days the scientists tracked how much the zones melted Places with extra algae melted much faster than areas where algae had been stripped away they were three times as likely to melt down to slush or exposed ice by the end of the test Exposing ice could amplify the algae s melting effects because bare ice reflects less and absorbs more sunlight than clean snow Using satellite imagery and remote sensing equipment the team then estimated the impact that algae have on snowmelt across the entire Harding Icefield Algae grew on more than a third of the sheet Within that square kilometer area the microbes were responsible for about percent of the snowmelt the team concluded Most of the rest of the melting was caused by warm temperatures There s a growing push to understand the impact of microorganisms on glaciers and ice sheets says Christopher Williamson a microbiologist at the University of Bristol in England who wasn t part of the study Scientists often rely on long term observations for these types of studies Williamson says but this research manipulates the environment to show a direct connection between algal growth and snowmelt The effect probably isn t limited to Alaska either A different team sampled red snow from across the Arctic and found that its presence decreased snow reflectivity by percent according to research published last year in Nature Communications Lower reflectivity would likely increase the snow s melt rate because it means more sunlight gets absorbed though that wasn t directly shown And if warming Arctic temperatures increase the area of snow algae s preferred habitat of just below freezing snow the microbes might expand their range further Other microbes or contaminants might also hasten glacial melt Williamson is part of a five year project investigating the impact of ice algae which is different than snow algae and bacteria on the Greenland ice sheet SN p He and colleagues want to figure out whether the dark tinge on the ice from those microbial residents helps explain why the ice sheet is melting faster than expected from climate change alone When it comes to some oddball fish looks can be deceiving Polypterus today found only in Africa and its close kin have generally been considered some of the most primitive ray finned fishes alive thanks in part to skeletal features that resemble those on some ancient fish Now a new analysis of fish fossils of an early polypterid relative called Fukangichthys unearthed in China suggests that those features aren t so old The finding shakes up the evolutionary tree of ray finned fishes making the group as a whole about million to million years younger than thought researchers propose online August in Nature Ray finned fishes named for the spines or rays that support their fins are the largest group of vertebrates making up about half of all backboned animals They include living species such as gars bowfins and salmon The group was thought to originate about million years ago in the Devonian Period But the new research using D CT scans of the previously discovered fossils shifts the fishes apparent origin to the start of the Carboniferous Period some million years ago says study coauthor Matt Friedman a paleontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor One of the largest extinction events in Earth s history marks the boundary between the Devonian and Carboniferous We know that many groups of backboned animals were hard hit by the event Friedman says But after the massive die off ray finned fishes popped up and according to previous fossil evidence their diversity exploded The new finding brings the origin of the modern ray finned fish group in line with this conspicuous pattern that we see in the fossil record Friedman says It suggests these vertebrates didn t survive the event They came after then flourished Empty space might feel hot to a traveler zipping through at a rapidly increasing clip or so some physicists predict And a new experiment provides a hint that they might be right That idea known as the Unruh effect seems to be supported by an analogous effect that appears in a tank of rippling water Patterns in the waves when analyzed as if seen by an accelerating observer appear to re create the expected signature of the effect researchers report September at arXiv org If it holds up to further scrutiny the result would mark the first time a version of the Unruh effect has been spotted It s a counterintuitive concept To an observer moving at a constant velocity a perfect vacuum would be frigidly cold But someone accelerating through that empty space might work up quite a sweat The Unruh effect is basically saying that if you are accelerated enough in the vacuum you can burn to death says theoretical physicist George Matsas of S o Paulo State University in Brazil Dreamt up in the s the Unruh effect named after one of its discoverers physicist William Unruh now at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver hinges on the fact that in quantum physics empty space is never truly empty Instead chaotic swirls of particles and antiparticles are constantly being created and annihilated For anyone moving at a constant velocity those particles are transient or virtual Such virtual particles appear to violate conservation of energy for a brief period of time a quirk made possible by Heisenberg s uncertainty principle But for an accelerating observer those particles would act like real persistent particles with well defined energies and producing a temperature that increases with greater acceleration But measuring the Unruh effect is a daunting task Observing a temperature of kelvin degree Celsius above absolute zero would require an acceleration billion billion times that generated by gravity on Earth s surface That requirement means the Unruh effect is unconfirmed leaving some scientists skeptical about whether it is real So physicist Ulf Leonhardt of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot Israel and colleagues set out to observe an analogous effect that wouldn t require such extreme acceleration A classical version of the Unruh effect minus the quantum mechanics occurs in waves on the surface of water the researchers report By vibrating a channel of water the scientists created waves reminiscent of the frothing vacuum that begets particles and antiparticles A video camera recorded the height of the resulting ripples The researchers traced the waves height along the trajectory an accelerating observer would have taken which produced a pattern analogous to a temperature When broken up according to their frequencies the distribution of ripples matched the frequencies of the radiation that would be associated with the temperature predicted by the Unruh effect This is a legitimate analog and the results are quite convincing says Matsas who was not involved with the research Study coauthor Leonhardt declined to comment on the work as it has yet to be peer reviewed The Unruh effect is closely related to Hawking radiation extremely faint radiation emitted by a black hole at a temperature determined by its mass Scientists have previously created black hole like states in water and thereby demonstrated something akin to Hawking radiation SN p Both Hawking radiation and the Unruh effect are intriguing to physicists as these phenomena connect quantum mechanics and gravity between which lies a poorly understood netherworld of physics It s a great idea to look for the Unruh effect in analogs says Silke Weinfurtner of the University of Nottingham in England But she notes the researchers haven t really accelerated the observer Instead they looked only at what a hypothetical observer might detect and deduced that such an observer would feel a pattern of ripples analogous to the temperature predicted due to the Unruh effect Likewise other physicists are waiting for further confirmation before getting too excited It is a very interesting paper says Germain Rousseaux of the University of Poitiers in France Still he says this is a first step I would be cautious with the conclusion Journalist Maryn McKenna opens Big Chicken by teasing our taste buds with a description of the succulent roasted chickens she bought at an open air market in Paris The birds tasted nothing like the bland uniform chicken offered at U S grocery stores This meat had an earthy lush animal flavor From this tantalizing oh so European tableau McKenna hits us with a sickening contrast scientists chasing outbreaks of drug resistant Salmonella infections in humans and ailing chickens living in crowded conditions and never seeing the light of day Antibiotics are at the root of both nightmares McKenna argues She draws clear connections between several dramatic foodborne outbreaks and the industrialization of chicken production made possible in large part by the heavy use of the drugs That reliance on antibiotics has also spurred the rise of drug resistant bacteria In fact the overuse of antibiotics in livestock is a bigger driver of resistance than the overuse of antibiotics in people Farmers began using the drugs after studies in the s showed that antibiotics boosted muscle mass For chickens that meant the birds got bigger and grew faster with less feed Today a meat chicken weighs twice what it did years ago at slaughter and reaches that weight in half the time Once farmers saw opportunity for growth and packed more birds into barns the drugs took on a new role to protect crowded animals from illness McKenna weaves in real people s stories with clearly explained scientific details and regulatory history If this story has a villain it s Thomas Jukes whose noble goal was to feed the world with cheap protein In the s Jukes was a researcher at Lederle Laboratories one of the first manufacturers of antibiotics He did some of the early studies testing the drugs as growth promoters He saw signs that bacteria were developing resistance but he saw no risk to the chickens McKenna writes Jukes railed against efforts in the s to regulate antibiotic use in livestock and up until he died in refused to acknowledge any downsides In addition to profiling farmers who embraced industrialization McKenna introduces those who have turned their backs on antibiotics These farmers including many in the United States have learned to raise drug free chickens mainly by going back to the old ways letting chickens roam free day and night pecking at grubs in the ground Some farms in the Netherlands even manage to raise industrial numbers of chickens without propping them up with antibiotics McKenna s story almost has a happy ending In the fast food restaurant Chick fil A announced it would within five years stop serving chicken raised with antibiotics Chicken producers as well as McDonald s Subway Costco and Walmart followed suit But we re not out of the woods yet McKenna warns She likens antibiotic resistance to climate change calling it an overwhelming threat created over decades by millions of individual decisions and reinforced by the actions of industries The book might not make you give up chicken but you may be more likely to look for sustainably raised birds to put on the dinner table Tiny balls of melanin could someday paint the rainbow They re one of the key ingredients in a new way to craft a spectrum of structural colors hues created when light interacts with special nanostructures Structural colors are a longer lasting alternative to chemical pigments which lose all pizazz when they break down Examples of durable hues abound in nature For instance many bird feathers and butterfly wings get their brilliant colors in part from nanoscale texturing SN p But finding a simple way to generate these complex structural colors a technique that can be scaled up and used to create many different hues has been a tricky task In the new study researchers made nano sized balls of melanin aggregate into clusters called supraballs Melanin the pigment that darkens skin appears black in the individual nanoparticles But altering the spacing of the nanoparticles in the ball affects how the particles scatter light generating a spectrum of structural colors says study coauthor Ali Dhinojwala a polymer scientist at the University of Akron in Ohio So he and colleagues added a thin silica coating to the outside of the melanin nanoparticles The coating acts like a bumper limiting how close the particles can pack together Varying the diameter of the melanin core and the thickness of the silica shell creates supraballs in a range of colors including olive orange red and navy blue the researchers report September in Science Advances This recipe is simpler than other ways of making structural colors in the lab Dhinojwala says The nanoparticles cluster into supraballs at room temperature in a mixture of water and an alcohol called octanol and are easy to extract as a powder Plus nanoparticles with different dimensions can be mixed in one supraball to create any shade imaginable Finding a great glue is a sticky task especially if you want it to attach to something as slick as the inside of the human body Even the strongest human made adhesives don t work well on wet surfaces like tissues and organs For surgeons closing internal incisions that s more than an annoyance The right glue could hold wounds together as effectively as stitches and staples with less damage to the surrounding soft tissue enabling safer surgical procedures A solution might be found under wet leaves on a forest floor recent research suggests Jianyu Li of McGill University in Montreal and colleagues have created a surgical glue that mimics the chemical recipe of goopy slime that slugs exude when they re startled The adhesive stuck to a pig heart even when the surface was coated in blood the team reported in the July Science Using the glue to plug a hole in the pig heart worked so well that the heart still held in liquid after being inflated and deflated tens of thousands of times Li who did the research while at Harvard University and colleagues also tested the glue in live rats with liver lacerations It stopped the rats bleeding and the animals didn t appear to suffer any bad reaction from the adhesive The glue has excellent excellent properties says Andrew Smith a biologist at Ithaca College in New York And slugs aren t the only biological inspiration for new adhesives Clues to better glues have long been hiding out in damp soggy and downright wet places For slugs mussels marine worms and a cadre of other critters secreting sticky substances that attach strongly to soaked surfaces is just a fact of life That s why scientists are studying the structures of those substances to design new and better surgical adhesives There s really a big need to develop new ways of sealing tissues of affixing devices to tissues in particular for minimally invasive procedures says Jeff Karp a biomedical engineer at Brigham and Women s Hospital in Boston While existing medical grade superglue is great at sealing up fingertip cuts it is too toxic to use inside the body Other alternatives just aren t sticky enough to fully replace stitches With a better glue surgeons could also make snips that are too tiny to be stitched or stapled closed Smaller incisions speed healing time and decrease risk of complications Karp says Smith says he isn t surprised that slug slime could lead to a big advance For several years he s been trying to understand how the slug Arion subfuscus builds its ooze For his research Smith prods slugs gently with the tip of a metal spatula to startle them and scoops up the slime as it s released If you get it on your hands it ll set within seconds into an extremely sticky material he says The goo Smith and others have found overcomes a major challenge that adhesive designers face It seems obvious that glue should be sticky Yet the molecules in glue need to adhere not just to the things you re trying to stick together but also to each other And that stickiness can t come at the expense of flexibility especially for medical applications Soft squishy organs are going to jiggle skin is going to stretch Without some bendiness the glue might attach securely to each of the surfaces being stuck together but the glob of glue itself might snap or shear under stress Slug defense slime solves that problem with two interwoven networks of molecules tangled together like strings of holiday lights One network is rigid with chemical bonds that break easily Smith says The other is deformable stretching substantially without breaking This combo makes the goo simultaneously tough flexible and sticky Li s slug inspired adhesive takes a similar approach One layer of the material is a polymer a type of material made from long molecules built from many repeated subunits like a string of beads Positively charged appendages dangling off the polymers are drawn to wet tissue surfaces by the same forces underlying static electricity This first layer weaves into another layer a water based gel The gel layer acts like a shock absorber in a car Li says It soaks up energy that might otherwise dislodge or snap the adhesive Despite being percent water the material is both sticky and tough Li says The fact that it s mostly water makes it more likely to be nontoxic to humans Though Li s adhesive has been tested only in human cell cultures and in lab animals another bio inspired glue has made its way into human trials It s based on work published by Karp and colleagues in in Science Translational Medicine Karp s team developed a viscous liquid that solidifies into a tough but stretchy glue when illuminated by light and demonstrated that the liquid can seal holes in hearts Nothing we create is really that similar to anything you see in nature but some of the ideas gave us critical insights Karp says The researchers realized for example that a lot of natural glues that work in water have hydrophobic elements that help clear away the water for a better stick The research sparked Karp and colleagues to found a company Gecko Biomedical which Karp now advises On September the company announced the completion of a small clinical trial of its adhesive The sealant immediately stopped blood flow after an artery clearing operation in about percent of participants Because of that success Gecko Biomedical now has approval to market the glue in Europe Bio inspired adhesives can do more than patch up incisions though Russell Stewart a bioengineer at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City is tapping into marine dwelling sandcastle worms for a different glue goal He wants to create a better embolic agent a way to deliberately block blood flow to certain tissues Embolic agents can cut blood flow to a tumor say or stem internal bleeding Often these materials are liquids that reach their target through a catheter and then solidify into a sticky mass to block tiny vessels But such glues can be difficult to control they need to harden at just the right time and current options often rely on harsh materials that require special equipment and can cause pain for patients Inspired by the sandcastle worm Phragmatopoma californica Stewart has designed a new and he thinks better embolic agent A sandcastle worm uses fingerlike appendages coming out of its face to arrange grains of sand into expansive tubular reefs It squirts small dabs of a liquid adhesive out of these appendages to make the grains stick together That glue s structure is quite different from slug slime Stewart has found It s a solution of oppositely charged proteins strongly attracted to each other The proteins make up a dense liquid that doesn t mix with water A worm packages each ingredient in the glue separately so the proteins combine only once secreted After mixing the glue solidifies in about seconds Stewart s mimic also starts out as a liquid that transforms into a hard foamlike material within a few seconds of hitting blood his team reported in in Advanced Healthcare Materials That means the material can be injected as a liquid and doesn t harden until it s in the right place Early tests have been promising The foam completely blocked the arteries of rabbits kidneys without moving into tissue where it didn t belong The range of biological adhesives is impressive says Jonathan Wilker a chemist at Purdue University in West LaFayette Ind They re so wildly different both in terms of chemical makeup and functional properties That diversity provides a wide palette for scientists seeking glues for specialized applications And Wilker s own work adds mussels to the list Mussels secrete a strong adhesive that helps them stick tenaciously to rocks and ship hulls Their secret is a molecule called DOPA Wilker says DOPA or dihydroxyphenylalanine sticks well to other DOPA molecules and to other substances That gives it the same balance of toughness and stickiness that s also found in slug slime Certain amino acids found in mussel proteins might also aid the underwater adhesion For example an amino acid called lysine that hangs off of mussel adhesion proteins appears to help clear water molecules out of the way leaving a drier surface for proteins glomming on Wilker s copycat adhesive is made up of long chains of polystyrene molecules essentially Styrofoam with units of DOPA mixed in Those long chains of tricked out polystyrene molecules tangle together and cross link to create a strong adhesive He s made different varieties of the mimic tailored for different applications After being immersed in water one version held on tighter underwater than the glue made by mussels themselves Wilker s team reported in February in Applied Materials Interfaces Another version is biodegradable If he can make the glues nontoxic to cells they could possibly be used inside the body In one recent study Wilker created an artificial adhesive protein that mimics the natural protein elastin The artificial version excelled in both dry and damp test environments his team reported in April in Biomaterials Bringing animal inspired adhesives into the human body won t necessarily be a simple task though It requires tackling some problems that other animals don t need to solve Karp says A slug for instance produces its slime as it needs it It doesn t stockpile gallons of glue in its tiny body or instantly churn out a year s supply A successful real world glue however will need to be easy to produce in large quantities and safe to store for months at a time Karp points out Those are problems humans will have to solve on their own That s the next challenge After years in space and years orbiting Saturn the veteran spacecraft spent its last seconds or so firing its thrusters as hard as it could to keep sending Saturnian secrets back to Earth for as long as possible The spacecraft entered Saturn s atmosphere at about a m PDT on September and immediately began running through all of its stabilizing procedures to try to keep itself upright The signal that Cassini had reached its destination arrived at Earth at a m and cut out about a minute later as the spacecraft lost its battle with Saturn s atmosphere The signal from the spacecraft is gone and within the next seconds so will be the spacecraft Cassini project manager Earl Maize announced from the mission control center at NASA s Jet Propulsion Lab I hope you re all as deeply proud of this amazing accomplishment Congratulations to you all This has been an incredible mission an incredible spacecraft and you re all an incredible team I m going to call this the end of mission Project manager off the net With that the mission control team erupted in applause hugs and some tears It s the end of an era But the spacecraft s last moments at Saturn will answer questions that couldn t have been addressed any other way Going out in a blaze of glory seems fitting Since its launch in the probe traveled a total of billion kilometers It gathered more than gigabytes of science data and took more than images It completed orbits of Saturn discovered six named moons and made close deliberate flybys of the ringed planet s largest and most interesting moons The last flyby sealed Cassini s fate On September at p m Cassini passed by Saturn s largest moon Titan one last time SN Online The moon s gravity nudged Cassini on an irretrievable trajectory into the giant planet s atmosphere Also blame the moons particularly lake dappled Titan and watery Enceladus for why Cassini went out in such dramatic fashion The mission team decided to sacrifice the spacecraft when it ran out of fuel rather than risk a collision with one of those potentially habitable moons and contaminating it with any still lingering earthly microbes Because of planetary protection and our desire to go back to Enceladus go back to Titan go back to the Saturn system we must protect those bodies for future exploration Jim Green director of NASA s planetary science division said at a news conference on September Even in its months long death spiral Cassini collected unprecedented observations Starting in April the spacecraft made dives through the unexplored region between Saturn and its rings Measurements of the gravity and composition in that zone will help solve outstanding mysteries How long is Saturn s day How much material is in the rings When and how did the rings form To answer that last question in particular you have to fly between the planet and the rings says planetary scientist Matthew Hedman of the University of Idaho in Moscow who uses Cassini data to study the rings That s risky We had to wait until the end of the mission to take that risk On September and Cassini took a last look around the Saturn system s greatest hits taking a color mosaic image of Saturn and the rings a movie sequence of Enceladus setting behind Saturn Titan and tiny moonlets in the rings that pull the icy ring particles around themselves to form features called propellers Inside the mission control center on the afternoon of September a hushed operations team waited for Cassini to come online for the last time to start sending the last pictures back SNOnline Then flight engineer Michael Staab at JPL suddenly broke the silence Yeah he yelled pumping both arms in the air Cassini s last signal had just come in That tells us that the spacecraft is nice and healthy she s doing just fine She s doing exactly what she s supposed to do like she s done for years Staab said We re just gonna track her now all the way in In the wee hours of September the spacecraft reconfigured itself to shift from a recording device to a transmitting probe As of that moment its last and only job was to stream everything it could sense directly back to Earth in real time Turning so that its ion neutral mass spectrometer was facing directly towards Saturn Cassini could taste the atmosphere for the first time and investigate a phenomenon called ring rain in which water and ice from the rings splash into the atmosphere This idea was introduced in the early s but Cassini has already shown that it s more complicated than previously thought We re trying to find out exactly what is coming from the rings and what is due to the atmosphere Hunter Waite Cassini team lead for the mass spectrometer instrument and an atmospheric scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio said at the Sept news conference That final plunge will allow us to do that That plunge happened at about a m when Cassini entered the atmosphere about degrees north of the equator falling at around kilometers per second It took data constantly directly measuring the temperature magnetic field plasma density and composition of the upper layers of Saturn s atmosphere for the first time ever When it hit the atmosphere Cassini started firing its thrusters to keep its antenna pointed at Earth despite the forces of the atmosphere trying to knock it askew But about a minute later the atmosphere won when Cassini was about kilometers above the cloud tops What happened next scientists can only imagine Models suggest this fiery demise The spacecraft attempted to stabilize itself but to no avail It started to tumble faster and faster Atmospheric friction broke the spacecraft apart bit by bit first its thermal blankets burned off then aluminum components started to melt The spacecraft probably fell another kilometers as it disintegrated like a meteor Maize said Saturn s atmosphere crushed and melted the bits and pieces until they completely dissociated and became part of the very planet the spacecraft had been sent to observe When all was said and done the spacecraft lasted about seconds longer than expected That may help ensure the team got enough data to figure out Saturn s rotation period science team member Michele Dougherty of Imperial College London said at a post mission news conference September I m hoping we can do it I m not going to promise Ask me in three months time There are no planned future missions to Saturn although some Cassini alumni are already working on proposals Outer solar system astronomers are now setting their sights on Jupiter and its icy possibly life friendly moons The European Space Agency s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer JUICE and NASA s Europa Clipper both hope to launch around Those missions may pave the way for a lander on Europa SN Online which could directly look for life in that moon s subsurface seas Planetary scientist Kevin Hand at JPL who is leading the science definition team for the proposed Europa lander feels a debt to Cassini When you re at the earliest frontiers of exploration it s hard to feel sad he said The wake we re experiencing right now for Cassini it s not so much an end but the early steps that pave the way for the next stage of exploration Even Maize is more proud than mourning This is exactly the way we always planned it It s sad that we re losing this incredible discovery machine he said in the moments leading up to Cassini s disintegration But the real sense here is just all right we got it Here are the final images from Cassini s last look around the Saturn system In its last hours before plunging into Saturn s atmosphere the Cassini spacecraft turned its cameras to the mission team s favorite objects the hydrocarbon shrouded moon Titan the geyser moon Enceladus and of course the majestic rings After sending these raw images back to Earth Cassini reconfigured itself to stream data efficiently in near real time Image files are too big to send in this mode so these are the last pictures Cassini will ever show us But it will send back unprecedented information about Saturn s atmosphere right up until the end Saturn looms large in this Sept raw image from the Cassini spacecraft The hazy moon Titan is the largest in the Saturn system Its gravity nudged Cassini onto its doomed orbit when the spacecraft flew by on September It s not every day that a spacecraft gets vaporized by the very planet it sought to explore After years studying Saturn and its moons NASA s Cassini spacecraft will plunge into the ringed gas giant s atmosphere The mission will come to a close at about a m EDT a m PDT Friday when Saturn s atmosphere pushes Cassini s antenna away from Earth terminating the signal Shortly thereafter the spacecraft will disintegrate If you want to keep tabs on the action you ve got a few options Science News astronomy writer Lisa Grossman is at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena Calif home of mission control for the Cassini probe She ll be popping on to the Science News Facebook page throughout the day Thursday with live updates and she astrolisa and Science News ScienceNews will have details for you on Twitter as well Cassini s death won t be captured on film But thanks to the internet you can watch NASA scientists react to the probe s impending doom live In the early hours of Friday morning a m EDT a m PDT NASA plans to stream a live video feed from the control room which you can watch here And you can also watch on NASA JPL s YouTube channel and NASA s Facebook page For more on Cassini s exploits check out all of our past coverage of the mission Kenneth Catania knows just how much it hurts to be zapped by an electric eel For the first time the biologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville has measured the strength of a defensive electrical attack on a real life potential predator himself Catania placed his arm in a tank with a centimeter long electric eel relatively small as eels go and determined in amperes the electrical current that flowed into him when the eel struck At its peak the current reached to milliamperes in his arm he reports online September in Current Biology This zap was painful enough to cause him to jerk his hand from the tank during each trial If you ve ever been on a farm and touched an electric fence it s pretty similar to that he says This is Catania s latest study in a body of research analyzing the intricacies of an electric eel s behavior The way electric eels have been described by biologists in the past has been fairly primitive says Jason Gallant a biologist who heads the Michigan State University Electric Fish Lab in East Lansing who was not involved in the study Catania s work reveals that what the electric eel is doing is taking the electric ability that it has and using that to its absolute advantage in a very sophisticated deliberate way he says Electric eels use electric current to navigate communicate and hunt for small prey But when faced with a large land based predator eels will launch themselves from the water and electrify the animal with a touch of the head Using electrical measurements he collected during the eel attacks Catania came up with an equation to estimate the amount of electric current flowing from the eel into his arm The electric shock was strongest when the electric eel was farthest out of the water That makes sense because when an eel is mostly submerged the majority of the electricity dissipates in the water As the eel rises out of the water the only place left for the electricity to flow is into whatever the fish head bumps SN Online Catania cannot say however whether a leap attack from an electric eel is equally as shocking for all potential predators Electrical currents travel through an animal more or less effectively depending on its outer layer The internal resistance or opposition to electrical current flow may be different for a human arm than for an animal with scales or fur like a crocodile or a dog Catania notes More research is needed to understand how powerful the shock is for other land animals Extrapolating from his experience with a small eel Catania estimates that a human struck on the trunk by a larger meter long electric eel might endure a current of amperes or watts of power That s about times as powerful as the zap from a typical law enforcement Taser gun Some bacteria may shield tumor cells against a common chemotherapy drug Certain types of bacteria make an enzyme that inactivates the drug gemcitabine researchers report in the Sept Science Gemcitabine is used to treat patients with pancreatic lung breast and bladder cancers Bacteria that produce the enzyme cytidine deaminase converted the drug to an inactive form That allowed tumor cells to survive gemcitabine treatment in lab dishes and mouse studies Leore Geller of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot Israel and colleagues discovered More than percent of the enzyme producing microbes belong to the Gammaproteobacteria class which includes E coliand about bacterial genera Pancreatic tumors taken from human patients also carried the enzyme producing bacteria Of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma samples studied contained gemcitabine inactivating bacteria Antibiotics may correct the problem In the study Geller and colleagues infected mice that had colon cancer with the enzyme producing bacteria Tumors grew rapidly in infected mice treated with gemcitabine alone Giving the mice antibiotics helped gemcitabine kill tumor cells increasing the number of tumor cells going through a type of cell death called apoptosis from about percent to percent or more That result may indicate that combinations of gemcitabine and antibiotics could make chemotherapy more effective for some cancer patients Artificial sweeteners can have a not so sweet side a bitter aftertaste The flavor can be such a turnoff that some people avoid the additives entirely Decades ago people noticed that for two artificial sweeteners saccharin and cyclamate which can taste bitter on their own the bitterness disappears when they re combined But no one really knew why It turns out that saccharin doesn t just activate sweet taste receptors it also blocks bitter ones the same bitter taste receptors that cyclamate activates And the reverse is true too The result could make your bitter batter better And it could help scientists find the next super sweetener Saccharin is times as sweet as sugar and cyclamate is to times as sweet as the real deal Saccharin has been in use since its discovery in and is best known as Sweet N Low in the United States Cyclamate was initially approved in the United States in but banned as a food additive in over concerns that it caused cancer in rats It remains popular elsewhere and is the sweetener behind Sweet N Low in Canada In the s scientists realized that the combination of the two sold in Europe under brand names such as Assugrin wasn t nearly as bitter as either sweetener alone But for the more than years since scientists didn t know why the combination of cyclamate and saccharin was such a sweet deal That s in large part because scientists simply didn t know a lot about how we taste The receptors for bitter flavors were only discovered in explains Maik Behrens a molecular biologist at the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam Rehbruecke Now we know that that there are potential bitter taste receptors and that people express them in varying levels That s why some people have strong responses to bitter flavors such as those in coffee while others might be more bothered by the bitter aftertaste of the sweetener put in it Behrens and his colleagues Kristina Blank and Wolfgang Meyerhof developed a way to screen which of the bitter taste receptors that saccharin and cyclamate were hitting to figure out why the combination is more palatable than either one alone The researchers inserted the genes for the subtypes into human kidney cells an easier feat than working with real taste cells Each gene included a marker that glowed when the receptors were stimulated Previous studies of the two sweeteners had shown that saccharin alone activates the subtypes TAS R and TAS R and cyclamate tickles TAS R and TAS R Stimulating any of those four taste receptor subtypes will leave a bitter taste in your mouth But cyclamate doesn t just activate the two bitter receptors Behrens and his colleagues showed It blocks TAS R and TAS R the same receptors that saccharin stimulates So with cyclamate around saccharin can t get at the bitter taste subtypes Behrens explains Bye bye bitter aftertaste The reverse was true too Saccharin blocked TAS R one of the bitter receptors that cyclamate activates In this case though the amount of saccharin required to block the receptors that cyclamate activates would have bitter effects on its own So it s probably the actions of cyclamate at saccharin s bitter receptors that help block the bitterness Behrens and his colleagues report September in Cell Chemical Biology The researchers also tested whether cyclamate and saccharin together could be stronger activators of sweet receptors than either chemical alone But in further tests Behrens and his colleagues showed that no the sweet sides of saccharin and cyclamate stayed the same in combination This addresses a longstanding puzzle why mixing two different sweeteners changes the aftertaste says Yuki Oka a neuroscientist at Caltech in Pasadena They are interrupting each other at the receptor level It s not too surprising that a sweetener might block some receptor subtypes and stimulate others he notes but that saccharin and cyclamate have such clear compatibilities is a lucky chance Mechanism wise it s surprisingly beautiful Oka notes that no actual tongues tasted artificial sweeteners in these experiments The tests took place on cells in dishes But he says because the researchers used the human bitter taste receptors it s likely that the same thing happens when a diet drink hits the human tongue Behrens hopes the cell setup they used for this experiment can do more than solve an old mystery By using cells in lab tests to predict how different additives might interact he notes scientists can develop sweeteners with fewer bitter effects The technique was developed with funding from a multinational group of researchers and companies many of which will probably be very interested in the sweet results And on the way to sweeteners of the future scientists may be able to resolve more taste mysteries of the past\n"

      "Original article: ﻿The deep waters of the East Pacific hold an unprepossessing treasure trove: potato-sized lumps of rock that contain valuable metals such as manganese, cobalt and copper. Turns out, such “manganese nodules” are home to another kind of goody: a species of sponge never before seen, researchers report online September 24 in Systematics and Biodiversity. These newly discovered nodule-dwellers may help scientists monitor the impact of future deep-sea mining.\n",
      "Little is known about life in the abyssal depths of the ocean, 4,000 to 6,000 meters down. But the prospect of mining in those depths is looming: For example, the United Nation’s International Seabed Authority has granted 16 exploration contracts for mining manganese nodules. To track how mining will affect deep-sea ecosystems over time, scientists are eager to establish a baseline of existing biodiversity in regions such as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), an area in the eastern Pacific Ocean littered with the nodules.\n",
      "The new sponge species may be the key to that baseline. Zoologist Swee-Cheng Lim of the National University of Singapore and colleagues examined samples of manganese nodules retrieved from the CCZ in 2015 that were covered in snow-white patches of sponge. Based on the sponges’ unusual star-shaped spicules — skeletal parts that support the sponge’s soft tissues — the team suspected they’d found a new species. DNA analyses confirmed it. Dubbed Plenaster craigi, this species’ proximity to the nodules may make it the perfect canary in the coal mine.\n",

      "﻿Here are some of the things Kay Tye relishes: break dancing, rock-climbing, snowboarding, poker, raising her young daughter and son. These adrenaline-fueled activities all require basic skills. But true mastery — and the joy Tye finds in them — comes from improvisation. She boldly steps into a void, a realm where she has to riff, and trusts that a flash of insight will lead the way out.\\nAs a 36-year-old neuroscientist studying how the brain creates experiences, Tye brings this mix of fearlessness and creativity to her lab, where it’s a key ingredient to her success. “Kay always finds this interesting twist,” says Leslie Vosshall, a molecular neurobiologist at Rockefeller University in New York City. Tye’s group at MIT investigates scientific questions in innovative ways, often with powerful results.\\nThe goal, Tye says, is ambitious: to identify — in neuroscientific terms — the core of what makes us individuals. We all live in the same world, but have vastly different experiences of it. Our private emotions and motivations are crucial for driving our behavior. But just how our inner mental lives are created, she says, is a mystery: “How do we actually ground the mind in the brain?”\\nSo far, Tye’s findings — which come in large part from tweaking nerve cells, and behaviors, in lab animals — have led to a deeper understanding of the intricate neural forces that shape experiences. Many of those forces may operate similarly in people, she believes.\\nOne insight came unexpectedly. After a series of experiments on how certain nerve cells respond to cocaine, the data were in shambles. But Tye and postdoctoral researcher Gillian Matthews didn’t shy from the project. Instead, they ventured into the void, hunting for inventive ways to explain the puzzling results.\\nIt turns out that these nerve cells, buried in a part of the mouse brain called the dorsal raphe nucleus, weren’t responding to cocaine at all. They were reacting to a mouse version of loneliness.   \\nIn the course of the experiments, some of the mice were isolated. In mice reintroduced to companions after a period of solitude, dorsal raphe nerve cells grew very active, Tye and colleagues reported in 2016 in Cell. Using a technique called optogenetics, developed in Karl Deisseroth’s lab at Stanford, where Tye was a postdoc, the researchers turned these same cells on artificially with a laser.\\nThough the mice didn’t seem to like the sensation, avoiding a place where the stimulation happened, the artificial kick made the mice more social. Tye suspects that these cells play a role in creating a sensation similar to loneliness or alleviating it by promoting social interactions. The results in mice offer a handhold to explore how these nerve cells might work together to create the mind.\\n“We threw away what we originally thought, completely,” Tye says. “The word cocaine doesn’t appear in the paper. It was really fun to go on that journey with [Matthews], because where we ended up was not where we thought we were going to go.”\\nIn another experiment using optogenetics, Tye and colleagues pitted the sensations of reward and punishment against each other in rats. Published in the June Nature Neuroscience, the results describe the neural pathways that help an animal decide whether to risk a shock for a sweet treat. Looking at reward and punishment simultaneously in this way is not something other researchers had done.\\nThese insights into motivated behaviors come from blending state-of-the-art techniques with clever experimental design, says neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux of New York University. The question of how the brain decides on a behavior is a classic one, and Tye is “taking it to a new level of neurobiological sophistication,” he says.\\nBut she’s not doing it alone. At MIT, where Tye also did her undergraduate work before going to the University of California, San Francisco for a Ph.D., she heads a research lab full of people Vosshall describes as “fiercely loyal and incredibly hardworking.”\\nHelping her graduate students find their scientific footing is one of Tye’s favorite parts of the job, a task she likens to the dynamic role of being a mother to young children. “It takes my breath away quite frequently,” Tye says, “to see someone blossom and grow and develop and get stronger and get more capable and more confident.”\\nThe joy Tye finds in nurturing her science tribe is obvious and no doubt provides opportunities to go off script. In science and in her personal life, she delights in the unexpected, an inclination evident from her poker game. Some poker players “grind it out,” playing a “very careful, tight game,” she says. “That’s not the way I enjoy playing. The hands I like being in the most are where anything can happen.”\\n\\n

      "﻿A genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease is a double, make that triple, whammy.\\nIn addition to speeding up the development of brain plaques associated with Alzheimer’s, a gene variant known as APOE4 also makes tau tangles — another signature of the disease — worse, researchers report online September 20 in Nature. APOE4 protein also ramps up brain inflammation that kills brain cells, neuroscientist David Holtzman of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and colleagues have discovered.\\n“This paper is a tour de force,” says Robert Vassar, a neuroscientist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “It’s a seminal study that’s going to be a landmark in the field” of Alzheimer’s research, Vassar predicts.\\nFor more than 20 years, researchers have known that people who carry the E4 version of the APOE gene are at increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s. A version of the gene called APOE3 has no effect on Alzheimer’s risk, whereas the APOE2 version protects against the disease. Molecular details for how APOE protein, which helps clear cholesterol from the body, affects brain cells are not understood.\\nBut Holtzman and other researchers previously demonstrated that plaques of amyloid-beta protein build up faster in the brains of APOE4 carriers (SN: 7/30/11, p. 9). Having A-beta plaques isn’t enough to cause the disease, Holtzman says. Tangles of another protein called tau are also required. Once tau tangles accumulate, brain cells begin to die and people develop dementia. In a series of new experiments, Holtzman and colleagues now show, for the first time, that there’s also a link between APOE4 and tau tangles.\\nIn one experiment, mice that had no A-beta in their brains developed more tau tangles if they carried the human version of APOE4than if they had the human APOE3 gene, Holtzman and colleagues found. That finding indicates APOE4 affects tau independently of A-beta.\\nBrains of people who died from various diseases caused by tangled tau had more dead and damaged cells if the people carried APOE4. The researchers also tracked 592 people who had low levels of A-beta in their cerebral spinal fluid — a clue that plaques have formed in the brain — and who showed symptoms of Alzheimer’s. Over a five- to 10-year period, the disease progressed 14 percent faster in people with one copy of APOE4 and 23 percent faster in people with two copies than in people who didn’t have that version of the gene, the researchers found. Those worsening symptoms are presumed to be caused by more rapid buildup of tau tangles in the APOE4 carriers.\\nAPOE4 also seems to make Alzheimer’s worse by causing inflammation, the researchers found. Two kinds of mouse glial brain cells, microglia and astrocytes, making different versions of the APOE protein were grown with brain nerve cells, or neurons, that make disease-causing forms of tau. Mouse neurons grown with glia making no APOE grew well, even though they were making abnormal tau. But neurons grown with glia making APOE4 often died. APOE4 provoked inflammation responses in the normally friendly astrocytes and microglia, leading those cells to kill neurons, the researchers found. Such inflammation can make brain degeneration worse.\\nThe data linking the APOE4 gene to tau tangles and brain inflammation is “super tight,” says molecular neurobiologist Sangram Sisodia of the University of Chicago. But the molecular details behind how APOE4 protein causes those effects are still vexingly absent, he says. Much more work is needed to uncover which molecules APOE4 interacts with, so that researchers can devise ways to counteract its negative effects in the brain.\\nAny therapies that decrease or eliminate APOE4 will need to be limited to the brain, because the protein is needed in the rest of the body to maintain healthy cholesterol levels, Vassar says. “You don’t want to give a person heart disease to cure Alzheimer’s disease.”\\n\\n

      "﻿Frog brains get busy long before they’re fully formed. Just a day after fertilization, embryonic brains begin sending signals to far-off places in the body, helping oversee the layout of complex patterns of muscles and nerve fibers. And when the brain is missing, bodily chaos ensues, researchers report online September 25 in Nature Communications.\\nThe results, from brainless embryos and tadpoles, broaden scientists’ understanding of the types of signals involved in making sure bodies develop correctly, says developmental biologist Catherine McCusker of the University of Massachusetts Boston. Scientists are familiar with short-range signals among nearby cells that help pattern bodies. But because these newly described missives travel all the way from the brain to the far reaches of the body, they are “the first example of really long-range signals,” she says.\\nCelia Herrera-Rincon of Tufts University in Medford, Mass., and colleagues came up with a simple approach to tease out the brain’s influence on the growing body. Just one day after fertilization, the scientists lopped off the still-forming brains of African clawed frog embryos. These embryos survive to become tadpoles even without brains, a quirk of biology that allowed the researchers to see whether the brain is required for the body’s development.\\nThe answer was a definite — and surprising — yes, Herrera-Rincon says. Long before the brain is mature, it’s already organizing and guiding organ behavior, she says. Brainless tadpoles had bungled patterns of muscles. Normally, muscle fibers form a stacked chevron pattern. But in tadpoles lacking a brain, this pattern didn’t form correctly. “The borders between segments are all wonky,” says study coauthor Michael Levin, also of Tufts University. “They can’t keep a straight line.”\\nNerve fibers that crisscross tadpoles’ bodies also grew in an abnormal pattern. Levin and colleagues noticed extra nerve fibers snaking across the brainless tadpoles in a chaotic pattern, “a nerve network that shouldn’t be there,” he says.\\nMuscle and nerve abnormalities are the most obvious differences. But brainless tadpoles probably have more subtle defects in other parts of their bodies, such as the heart. The search for those defects is the subject of ongoing experiments, Levin says.\\nIn addition to keeping patterns on point, the young frog brain may protect its body from chemical assaults. A molecule that binds to certain proteins on cells in the body had no effect on normal embryos. But when given to brainless embryos, the same molecule caused their spinal cords and tails to grow crooked. These results suggest that early in development, brains keep embryos safe from agents that would otherwise cause harm.\\n“The brain is instructing cells that are really a long way away from it,” Levin says. While the precise identities of these long-range signals aren’t known, the researchers have some ideas. When brainless embryos were dosed with a drug that targets cells that typically respond to the chemical messenger acetylcholine, the muscle pattern improved. Similarly, the addition of a protein called HCN2 that can tweak the activity of cells also seemed to improve muscle development. More work is needed before scientists know whether these interventions are actually mimicking messaging from the early brain, and if so, how.\\nFrog development isn’t the same as mammalian development, but frog development “is pretty applicable to human biology,” McCusker says. In fundamental ways, humans and frogs are built from the same molecular toolbox, she says. So the results hint that a growing human brain might also interact similarly with a growing human body.\\n\\n

      "﻿For the first time, researchers have disabled a gene in human embryos to learn about its function.\\nUsing molecular scissors called CRISPR/Cas9, researchers made crippling cuts in the OCT4 gene, Kathy Niakan and colleagues report September 20 in Nature. The edits revealed a surprising role for the gene in the development of the placenta.\\nResearchers commonly delete and disable genes in mice, fruit flies, yeast and other laboratory critters to investigate the genes’ normal roles, but have never done this before in human embryos. Last year, government regulators in the United Kingdom gave permission for Niakan, a developmental biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in London, and colleagues to perform gene editing on human embryos left over from in vitro fertilization treatments (SN Online: 2/1/16). The researchers spent nearly a year optimizing techniques in mouse embryos and human stem cells before conducting human embryo experiments, Niakan says.\\nThis groundbreaking research allows researchers to directly study human development genes, says developmental biologist Dieter Egli of Columbia University. “This is unheard of. It’s not something that has been possible,” he says. “What we know about human development is largely inferred from studies of mice, frogs and other model organisms.”\\nOther researchers have used CRISPR/Cas9 to repair mutated genes in human embryos (SN: 4/15/17, p. 16; SN: 9/2/17, p. 6). The eventual aim of that research is to prevent genetic diseases, but it has led to concerns that the technology could be abused to produce “designer babies” who are better looking, smarter and more athletic than they otherwise would be.\\n“There’s nothing irresponsible about the research in this case,” says stem cell researcher Paul Knoepfler of the University of California, Davis, School of Medicine. The researchers focused on basic questions about how one gene affects human embryo development. Such studies may one day lead to better fertility treatments, but the more immediate goal is to gain better insights into human biology.\\nNiakan’s group focused on a gene called OCT4 (also known as POU5F1), a master regulator of gene activity, which is important in mouse embryo development. This gene is also known to help human embryonic stem cells stay flexible enough to become any type of body cell, a property known as pluripotency. Scientists use OCT4 protein to reprogram adult cells into embryonic-like cells, an indication that it is involved in early development (SN: 11/24/07, p. 323). But researchers didn’t know precisely how the OCT4 gene operates during human development. Niakan already had clues that it works at slightly different times in human embryos than it does in mice (SN: 10/3/15, p. 13).\\nIn the experiment, human embryos lacking OCT4 had difficulty reaching the blastocyst stage: Only 19 percent of edited embryos formed blastocysts, while 47 percent of unedited embryos did. Blastocysts are balls of about 200 cells that form about five or six days after fertilization. The ball’s outer layer of cells gives rise to the placenta. Inside the blastocyst, one type of embryonic stem cells will become the yolk sac. Another kind, about 20 cells known as epiblast progenitor cells, will give rise to all the cells in the body.  \\nNiakan and colleagues predicted from earlier work with mice and human embryonic stem cells that the protein OCT4 would be necessary for the epiblast cells to develop correctly. As predicted, “knocking out” the OCT4 gene disrupted epiblasts’ development. What the researchers didn’t expect is that OCT4 also affects the development of the placenta precursor cells on the outside of the blastocyst.\\n“That’s not predicted anywhere in the literature,” Niakan says. “We’ll be spending quite a lot of time on this in the future to uncover exactly what this role might be.”\\n\\n

      "﻿To the residents of Donora, Pa., a mill town in a crook of the Monongahela River, the daily haze from nearby zinc and steel plants was the price of keeping their families fed. But on October 27, 1948, the city awoke to an unusually sooty sky, even for Donora. The next day, the high school quarterbacks couldn’t see their teammates well enough to complete a single pass.\\nThe town was engulfed in smog for five days, until a storm finally swept the pollution out of the valley. By then, more than one-third of the population had fallen ill and 20 people were dead. Another 50 perished in the following months.\\nAfter the Donora tragedy, the federal government began to clamp down on industries that release pollutants into the air. Environmental advocates in the coming decades fought for, and won, tighter regulations. As a result, combined emissions of six common air pollutants have dropped by about 70 percent nationwide since the 1970 passage of the Clean Air Act, which regulates U.S. emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In 35 major U.S. cities, the total number of days with unhealthy air has fallen by almost two-thirds just since 2000. “It’s one of the great success stories of public health,” says Joel Kaufman, a physician and epidemiologist at the University of Washington School of Public Health in Seattle.\\nOur bodies feel the difference. One study, reported in JAMA last year, followed 4,602 children in Southern California between 1993 and 2012 to see how lung health correlated with three common air pollutants. As levels of ozone, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter fell over time, so did the number of children who reported a daily cough, persistent congestion and other symptoms of irritated lungs. At the start of the study, 48 percent of children with asthma had reported bronchitis symptoms in the previous year. In communities with the greatest drop in pollutants during the study period, bronchitis prevalence fell by as much as 30 percent in children with asthma.\\nBut the air pollution story isn’t over. Researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston recently reported on links between air quality and mortality throughout the entire U.S. Medicare population (more than 60 million people who are age 65 and older or disabled). The analysis looked at levels of two common air pollutants and death rates from 2000 to 2012, while accounting for factors that might confound the results, such as race and socioeconomic status. The analysis, published in June in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that when pollutant levels rose (but remained at levels below national standards), so did death rates.\\nEven with vast improvements in air quality since the ’70s, people haven’t stopped dying from the air they breathe. An analysis published in 2013 from researchers at MIT estimated that about 200,000 premature deaths occur each year in the United States because of fine particulate air pollution. A study published in January in Environmental Health Perspectives reported that daily deaths over a decade in metropolitan Boston peaked on days when concentrations of three common air pollutants were at their highest, even though those levels would currently satisfy the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\\n“We’ve made these improvements in exposure,” Kaufman says, “but what more do we need to clean up?”\\nSo despite a half-century of progress, airborne grime is still a menace — probably in ways the people of Donora never imagined. Researchers are now finding that more than the lungs are at risk, as dirty air may in fact be an accomplice to some of the greatest threats to public health, including diabetes, obesity and even dementia. Those studies are likely to inform the ongoing debate over antismog rules. The U.S. House of Representatives voted this summer to delay implementation of updated standards for the Clean Air Act.\\nSlow burn\\nAs it has for more than a century, air pollution in America largely arises from power plants, industries, vehicles and other sources of fuel burning. The pollution is generally a mixture of gases — such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides — and particulate matter, microscopic solids or droplets that can be inhaled into the lungs. The pollutant that has declined the least is ozone, a hard-to-control noxious gas formed when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds react with sunlight. Ozone pollution tends to soar on hot, windless summer days as the sun blazes.\\nParticulates come from tail pipes and smokestacks, but also consist of tiny fragments shed from tires, roads and brake pads. Fine particulates (less than 2.5 micrometers wide, or about a quarter of the width of the smallest grain of pollen) are of greatest concern because they can penetrate deeply into the lungs to reach the body’s innermost nooks and crannies. A study in April in the journal ACS Nano demonstrated that fact. Fourteen healthy volunteers intermittently riding exercise bikes inhaled gold nanoparticles — stand-ins for particulates — and 15 minutes later, the nanoparticles were detected in the bloodstream and remained present in the body for as long as three months.\\nWhile events in Donora showed that air pollution can have immediate consequences, it took decades for researchers to realize that deaths from smog could be going undetected, lost in the background noise of mortality statistics. In 1993, Harvard University scientists published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine looking at mortality rates among adults in six U.S. cities. The researchers studied more than 8,000 people for 14 to 16 years. In areas with higher levels of sulfate particles in the air, a measure of pollution, mortality rates were higher. Dozens of similar studies have followed, including one published in 2003 that looked at death rates across 20 of the largest U.S. cities. That research found that the highest death rates occurred the day after particulate concentrations reached their highest levels, though the levels were subtle enough to go unnoticed at the time.\\nScientists now know that inhaling pollutants triggers a flurry of physiological coping mechanisms throughout the body. “Until 20 years ago, we thought that air pollution affected only the respiratory system,” says Petros Koutrakis, an environmental chemist who heads the EPA Harvard Center for Ambient Particle Health Effects. By 2004, the American Heart Association published a consensus statement in Circulation laying out “a strong case that air pollution increases the risk of cardiovascular disease,” the leading cause of U.S. deaths.\\n\\nMore studies followed that statement, including one from Kaufman and colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2007. The researchers studied 65,893 women, looking for a link between exposure to fine particulates and death from heart attack or stroke, or even nonfatal heart attacks or the need for artery-clearing procedures. In the end, each increase of 10 micrograms of fine particulates per cubic meter of air increased the risk of any cardiovascular health event by 24 percent and the risk of dying from heart attack or stroke by 76 percent. In 2010, the American Heart Association updated its position: “The overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between [fine particulate] exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.” While the mechanism is still under study, research points to inflammation, heart rate variability and blood vessel damage.\\nEvidence keeps accumulating. A study by Koutrakis and colleagues, published in 2012 in Archives of Internal Medicine, found similar results. When particulate concentrations rose even to mild levels — those classified as a “moderate health concern for a very small number of people” by EPA standards — the risk of stroke rose by 34 percent within a day of exposure.\\nPounds and pollution\\nLately, studies have moved from cardiovascular disease into more unexpected territory. And they’ve turned up compelling evidence that air quality may contribute to excess body weight. Frank Gilliland, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, became intrigued when laboratory studies suggested that certain pollutants in the environment might function as “obesogens,” contributing to weight gain by mimicking or disrupting the action of hormones, or having other effects. Still, he says, “I was very skeptical.”\\nOut of curiosity, he began to look for a link between childhood obesity and living close to a major roadway. His first study, published in 2010, examined over 3,000 children across California. Although the researchers found an association, they couldn’t rule out other explanations that would also lead back to cars. “Maybe the kids aren’t getting exercise because there’s a lot of traffic out,” he says.\\nNewer findings are more convincing, including a 2014 study by Gilliland and colleagues. They studied body mass index among children exposed to traffic-related air pollution. Of course, as the children grew over the five-year study period, their BMIs increased from an average of 16.8 to 19.4 kilograms per square meter. But children exposed to the most air pollution, compared with those least exposed, had a 14 percent larger BMI increase, which meant an additional 0.4 kg/m2 increase in BMI by age 10. Adults, too, appear to be affected. Researchers from Harvard Medical School and elsewhere published a study in 2016 in the journal Obesity looking at whether adults living with constant exposure to traffic are more likely to be overweight. In particular, people who lived within 60 meters of a major road had a higher BMI, by 0.37 kg/m2, and more fat tissue than those who lived 440 meters from a busy road. The healthy range for an adult’s BMI is 18.5 to 25 kg/m2.\\nStudies in animals have started to offer hints why this might be the case. Last year in the FASEB Journal, Chinese researchers described an experiment in which one group of pregnant rats was raised in filtered air scrubbed of pollutants, while another breathed the usual Beijinghaze. Though they were fed the same diet, the animals living in Beijing air were heavier at the end of their pregnancies, as were their offspring that continued to breathe the dirty air eight weeks after birth. Among later autopsy findings: Rats exposed to pollution experienced higher levels of inflammation, which is thought to be a contributor to weight gain and metabolic disruption.\\nThe relationship is probably subtle, and interwoven with genetics and lifestyle. UCLA researchers who followed a large group of African-American women over 16 years found no association between weight and exposure to particulates. For now, the connection between obesity and pollution is still a subject of investigation. But given that 11 million Americans live along major roadways, even a small effect could have widespread consequences.\\nLinks to diabetes\\nFor many people, diabetes goes hand in hand with obesity. One of the earliest compelling studies to suggest a relationship between diabetes and air pollution was an animal experiment published in 2009 in Circulation from researchers at Ohio State University and other institutions. The test was relatively simple: Two groups of mice were fed a high-fat diet for 24 weeks. One lived in clean, filtered air; the other group was housed in enclosures polluted with air containing fine particulates, at concentrations still within EPA standards. The mice breathed the polluted air for six hours per day, five days a week for 128 days. Even though they ate the same food, the mice living in dirty air developed metabolic changes characteristic of insulin resistance while the other mice did not. Similarly, a 2013 study from EPA scientists found that mice exposed to ozone can develop glucose intolerance, a precursor for diabetes.\\nIn July in Diabetes, Gilliland and colleagues published data not only finding links between air pollution and diabetes in children, but also insight into the body’s physiological response. In the study, 314 overweight or obese children in Los Angeles were followed for an average of three years. At the end of the study, children who lived in neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and particulates had experienced greater declines in insulin sensitivity and had signs of impaired pancreatic beta cells, which produce insulin.\\nAs for adults, a study this year in Environment International, conducted by researchers from eight institutions, tracked more than 45,000 African-American women across the United States. Those who were exposed to the highest concentrations of ozone were about 20 percent more likely to develop diabetes, even after adjusting for other possible explanations such as diet and exercise levels.\\nBrain drain\\nOne of the latest lines of research suggests that poisons in the air might accelerate aging in the brain. Studies have long documented the connection between the nose and brain function. For reasons not yet known, for instance, one of the early signs of Parkinson’s disease is a loss of the ability to distinguish smells.\\nDuring her graduate studies at Harvard, Jennifer Weuve, now an epidemiologist at the Boston University School of Public Health, wondered if airborne pollutants might be bad for the brain. “There was really intriguing data from animal studies,” she says, which showed that inhaled pollutants had toxic effects on nerve cells. In 2012, she published the first study to note a faster-than-normal cognitive decline among people exposed to higher levels of particulates, both those smaller than 2.5 micrometers and even larger ones that are thought to be less harmful. Her study, published in Archives of Internal Medicine, analyzed data from the Nurses’ Health Study Cognitive Cohort, which included almost 20,000 women ages 70 to 81, and used geographic information and air-monitoring data to estimate pollution exposure.\\nMore recently, researchers from Sweden examined the relationship between pollution exposure and dementia, studying the records of people in northern Sweden participating in a long-term study of memory and aging. In 2016 in Environmental Health Perspectives, the researchers reported that people with the most exposure to air pollution were also the most likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia. In all, more than a dozen human studies have examined pollution’s link to dementia. Last year in NeuroToxicology, Weuve and colleagues reviewed 18 human studies published as of late 2015, and concluded that as a whole, the evidence was “highly suggestive” and in need of more exploration. “What is it going to take for more people to take this seriously?” Weuve asks.\\nWhile the relationship is far from established, animal data may help clarify the results. One study published this year in Neurobiology of Aging, from researchers at the University of Southern California, examined brain changes in mice exposed to particulate air pollution at levels commonly found near freeways. After exposure to the pollution for five hours per day, three days a week for 10 weeks, the animals showed accelerated aging in the hippocampus, a region of the brain associated with memory. And a 2015 study of older women exposed to high levels of particulate matter, at levels common in the eastern half of the United States and in parts of California, showed a small decrease in the volume of white matter, the myelin-coated nerve cell projections called axons.\\nParkinson’s disease may also be linked to pollution. Danish researchers, with colleagues in the United States and Taiwan, published a study last year in Environmental Health Perspectives looking at people with and without Parkinson’s and their exposure to nitrogen dioxide, a marker for traffic-polluted air. The scientists identified 1,828 people in Denmark with Parkinson’s diagnosed between 1996 and 2009, and compared them with about the same number of randomly selected healthy people. Those exposed to the highest levels of air pollution had the greatest risk of developing the disease. The data, the researchers wrote, “raise concern given the increase in vulnerable aging populations.”\\nIf science bears out the connection between pollution and brain health, or pollution and metabolism, environmental advocates and businesses may have even more reason to push for cleaner air. Researchers hope in the future to have more data on which pollutants cause the greatest harm, and why. In Donora, the site of one of the country’s biggest air pollution disasters, a sign at the Smog Museum now reads “Clean Air Started Here.” No one can yet say how clean is clean enough.\\n\\n    0.331047\n",
      "﻿By early next spring, astronomer David Kipping hopes to know if the object he’s spent his early career searching for is really there.\\nAn astronomer at Columbia University, Kipping is perhaps most known for a project sifting through data from the Kepler space telescope on more than a thousand planets orbiting distant stars. But he’s more interested in their moons. A moon could be a home to alien life even if its planet is inhospitable (SN: 2/9/13, p. 5). A moon could also make its host planet more likely to harbor life. Some models suggest that the presence of our moon might have helped make Earth a nice place to live. The same could be true for other moon-planet partnerships.\\nSo Kipping’s search, dubbed the Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler, gets at the fundamental nature of our place in the universe: Are we alone?\\nIn late October, Kipping and colleagues will use the Hubble Space Telescope to find out if they’ve caught their first quarry. The possible candidate is a Neptune-sized object orbiting the planet Kepler 1625b (SN: 8/19/17, p. 15). If the candidate turns out to be a genuine exomoon — Kipping is quick to point out that similar hints have fizzled before — he will no doubt solidify his reputation as “the moon guy.”\\nBut he dabbles in a lot of things. “I write a lot of failed papers,” he admits. He arrived at exomoons by following a simple philosophy: No idea is too crazy.\\n“His signature projects are quite risky, but with obvious large payback,” says Dimitar Sasselov, director of the Harvard Origins of Life Initiative, who worked with Kipping in his postdoc research at Harvard University.\\nKipping, now 33, grew up in a small town in England. He loved Star Trek, wanted to be an astronaut and memorized the names and masses of all the planets in the solar system — and their moons.\\nSupportive teachers encouraged him to pursue a career in physics at a time when exoplanet research was just starting to be taken seriously. By 2003, when he was an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, there were a few dozen known exoplanets. But there are 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. “It felt like there was a huge wave of discovery waiting to happen,” Kipping says.\\nSix years later, NASA launched Kepler and within five years, the number of known exoplanets ballooned to well over 1,000.\\nAll the planets Kepler has picked up made themselves known by blocking their star’s light as they crossed, or transited, in front of the star. Those transits produce a characteristic U-shape in graphs of starlight over time. As a graduate student at University College London, Kipping considered what the U-shaped graphs might reveal about the planets. Researchers already knew that deeper U’s mean larger planets, for example. More frequent U’s mean shorter orbital periods.\\nWhile staring at the stars on a hiking trip in the Himalayas, Kipping thought of something else that could change the U. “It was just obvious to me that a moon could screw it up,” he says. A large enough moon would create an occasional extra dip in the light.\\nIn the early days of the exoplanet boom, actually looking for such dips in the Kepler data was an audacious notion. But Kipping jumped in anyway. “I assumed it would be a tiny effect, but it turned out to be detectable,” Kipping says. His paper, published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in 2009, pointed out that Kepler could be used to search for exomoons, too.\\nTo pursue the search in earnest, Kipping taught himself new data processing techniques. The problem proved so computationally intensive that he turned to crowdfunding to buy a supercomputer while a postdoc at Harvard. His hunt caught on in the popular press, with write-ups in Time magazine and Wired. And other scientists joined the chase as well, with several more groups announcing competing searches in the past few years.\\nThere’s a reason Kipping’s team has found only one exomoon candidate so far: There aren’t many out there big enough for Kepler to see, according to his statistical work. “Because he’s doing such a careful job, it probably means something,” Sasselov adds. The systems the team has checked that show no moons most likely aren’t hiding any.\\nAs a new faculty member at Columbia, Kipping has lately turned his attention to teaching, mentoring and outreach. Many of his students say he supports their wildest pursuits — even those outside astronomy, like machine learning or linguistics.\\n“He’s known for out-there ideas,” says current graduate student Moiya McTier, who first worked with Kipping as an undergrad student in the Banneker Institute at Harvard, a program to prepare students of color for careers in astronomy. “Which is great, because I don’t feel afraid of going to him with my own crazy ideas.”\\nKipping’s latest experiment is a YouTube channel aimed at nonscientists. “Outreach isn’t really rewarded in the academic world,” he says. “It’s a thing I wouldn’t have done as a postdoc, but felt it was a risk I was willing to take as a faculty member.”\\nIt has paid unexpected scientific dividends already. While preparing a video about the Breakthrough Starshot initiative, which aims to send tiny spacecraft at 20 percent the speed of light to visit the nearest star to the sun (SN: 9/2/17, p. 4), Kipping realized there was an error in the Breakthrough team’s calculations of the photon pressure needed to propel the craft. The error connected back to Albert Einstein’s 1905 paper about special relativity and came from some assumptions made for simplicity that wouldn’t hold in real life.\\nKipping’s paper discussing the error was published in June in the Astronomical Journal.\\n“I would never have written a paper about special relativity if I hadn’t been doing outreach about Starshot,” he says. His philosophy makes more sense every year: Let all the crazy in. You never know where it will lead.\\n\\n

      "﻿To choose her research goals, Jennifer Dionne envisions conversations with hypothetical grandchildren, 50 years down the line. What would she want to tell them she had accomplished? Then, to chart a path to that future, “I work backward to figure out what are the milestones en route,” she says.\\nThat long-term vision has led the 35-year-old materials scientist on a quest to wrangle light and convince it to do her bidding in interactions with nanoparticles and various materials. Already, Dionne has created new nanomaterials that steer light in ways that are impossible with natural substances. Her new projects could eventually lead to light-based technologies used to improve drugs or to create new tests to find cancerous cells. There are even applications for renewable energy, for example, designing materials that help solar cells absorb more light.\\nBut the route to a scientific vision may not always be clear, so Dionne makes time for diversions. “A lot of the really amazing discoveries that we enjoy today came from just playing in the lab,” she says. Dionne encourages her team to let creativity be a guide, melding a serious sense of purpose with play.\\n“She’s a very curious person, so she’s always learning new things,” says Paul Alivisatos, the vice chancellor for research at the University of California, Berkeley, who mentored Dionne when she was a postdoc there. Plus, “she’s an extremely deep and rigorous thinker.”\\nDionne, now at Stanford University, studies nanophotonics, the way that light interacts with matter on very small scales. Her interest in light and materials began in childhood, she recalls, when she was fascinated by the blue morpho butterfly.\\nThe insect’s wings sport an azure hue that comes not from pigments, like most colors found in living things, but from tiny nanostructures on the wings’ surface (SN: 6/7/08, p. 26). When light reflects off the structures, blue wavelengths are amplified, while wavelengths corresponding to other colors are canceled out.\\nThat early interest in tricks of light led Dionne to begin wielding it as a tool during graduate school at Caltech and then her postdoc at UC Berkeley.  Then and now, says Alivisatos, “she has consistently done very beautiful work.”\\nAt Caltech, Dionne and colleagues created a bizarre optical material in which light bends backward. As light passes from one material to another — say, from air to water — the rays are deflected due to a property called the index of refraction. (That’s why a straw in a drinking glass appears to be broken at the water’s surface.) In natural materials, light always bends in the same direction. But that rule gets flipped around in oddball nanomaterials with a negative index of refraction.\\nDionne’s material, reported in Science in 2007, was the first that worked with visible light (SN: 3/24/07, p. 180). Because they can steer light around objects to hide the objects from view, such materials could be used to create rudimentary versions of invisibility cloaks — though so far all attempts are a far cry from Harry Potter’s version. Dionne is now working on a “squid skin” with an adjustable refractive index, which would mimic the shifting camouflage patterns of the stealthy cephalopod.\\nAnother focal point of Dionne’s research is harnessing light to separate mixtures of mirror-image molecules. Right- and left-handed versions of these molecules are perfect reflections of each other, like a person’s right and left hands. The two types are so similar that scientists struggle to separate them, which can cause problems for drugmakers. In drugs, these molecules can be two-faced; one might relieve pain, while the other causes unwanted side effects.\\nTo separate molecules and their mirror images, Dionne is developing techniques that use circularly polarized light, in which the light’s wiggling electromagnetic waves rotate over time. Such light can interact differently with right- and left-handed molecules, for example, breaking apart one version while leaving the other unscathed.\\nNormally, the light’s effect is very weak. But in a theoretical study published in ACS Photonics last December, Dionne and colleagues showed that adding nanoparticles to the mix could enhance the process. These tiny particles behave like antennas that concentrate the light onto nearby molecules, helping break them apart. Dionne is now working to implement the technique.\\nShe and her colleagues have also created nanoparticles that, when illuminated with infrared light, emit visible light. The color of that light changes depending on how tightly the nanoparticle is squeezed, the team reported in Nano Letters in June. In keeping with her penchant for creative exploration in the lab, Dionne and colleagues fed these nanoparticles to roundworms, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, to study the forces exerted as a transparent worm squeezed a meal through its digestive tract.\\n“You can see the nanoparticles change colors throughout,” Dionne says. She plans to use the technique to reveal more sinister squeezing. Cancer cells exert stronger mechanical forces on their environment than healthy cells, so such nanoparticles could one day be used to test for cancer, she says. Dionne is now cooking up other creative ways to use these nanoparticles. In collaboration with other researchers, she hopes to marshal her color-changing nanoparticles to understand how jellyfish move and how plants take a drink.\\nDionne’s work exploits light to reveal hidden forces — and as a force for good. “She’s done amazing work,” says materials scientist Prineha Narang of Harvard University. Narang was a graduate student at Caltech after Dionne left, and had heard chatter about Dionne before meeting her in person. “The legend of Jen Dionne was definitely all over,” Narang says. So Dionne has made a start at establishing her scientific legacy — even before that chat with her future grandchildren.\\n\\n

      "﻿Ninad Kothari’s workplace looks like something out of a sci-fi film. The graduate student at Johns Hopkins University works in a darkened, red-lit room, where he trains bats to fly through obstacle courses. Shielding within the walls keeps radio and other human-made signals from interfering with transmissions from the tiny electrical signals he’s recording from the bats’ brains as the animals bob and weave. Layers of foam further insulate the cavelike lab against sound waves. An array of cameras and microphones complete the futuristic scene.\\nThe high-tech setup has its homemade touches, too: In one obstacle course, bats dodge dangling Quaker oatmeal cylinders.\\nKothari is part of a small cadre of neuroscientists who are getting the best sense yet of how bat brains work at a cellular level, thanks to modern technologies. Eavesdropping tools, which rely on tiny probes that track the activities of individual nerve cells, or neurons, are now miniaturized enough to outfit bats with head-mounted, wireless sensors. As the animals fly freely around the lab, the researchers can listen in on neurons. \\nBy allowing the bats to behave naturally, unencumbered by bulky equipment, scientists will discover exciting new facets of how bat brains work, says neuroscientist Nachum Ulanovsky of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, who invented the new wireless sensors with colleagues. He and others, studying several different species of bats, are investigating how the flying mammals perceive their environment and navigate through it.\\nThe go-to lab animals for studying how the mammalian brain maps and navigates its surroundings are mice and rats. But bat researchers say their animal of choice offers distinct advantages. For one, rodent navigation studies are mostly limited to fairly basic environments in the lab, such as mazes. Those setups are “too simple to tell much about how the system operates in complex environments in the real world,” says Edvard Moser of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. Moser shared a 2014 Nobel Prize for discovering place cells in the rodent brain (SN Online: 10/6/14). Place cells help the animal identify its location in a mental map of the environment.\\nSince bats fly, scientists can more easily investigate how bat brains deal with space in three dimensions. Researchers are already reporting on new types of neurons not yet observed in rodents or other animals. Moser expects that rodent and human brains may map and navigate spaces in a manner similar to bats; scientists have already seen “striking” parallels between rat and bat brains, he says.\\nBats are also interesting to scientists because bat brains must switch between several kinds of input to make sense of the world. Like people, they use their ears and eyes (contrary to popular myth, no bat species is entirely blind, though some rely on vision more than others). On top of that, most bats also use echolocation to sense their surroundings. While flying, an echolocating bat produces calls that bounce off objects — such as trees to avoid or insects to chase — then return to the bat as echoes. With their supersensitive ears, and their finely tuned brains, bats use this information to determine where things are. The echolocation calls are typically beyond the range of human hearing, which is good because the calls are quite loud, about 100 decibels or so, says Khaleel A. Razak, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Riverside. He likens the volume to what a person would experience standing next to a pounding jackhammer.\\nBy tracking the routes bats fly, as well as their calls and the echoes they pick up, bat-brain aficionados are starting to match behavior with brain activity. In some of the most recent studies, scientists have begun to figure out how bats pinpoint the locations of the sounds of prey and map and navigate the greater world. The researchers may have a thing or two to teach sonar engineers. \\nGoing natural\\nTo understand bats’ brain activity at the level of individual neurons, researchers implant tiny wires. The aim is to read when individual neurons “fire,” that is, when one brain cell generates an electrical signal to send along to other cells in the brain or body. Exactly what these neurons are communicating remains hazy, but they might, for example, tell another part of the brain that there’s a sound coming in from the right or left.\\nThe hippocampus is where Ulanovsky focuses. This deep-brain structure, involved in learning and memory, is a place where bats make and store maps of their surroundings. Usually neuroscientists have to tether an animal to a bulky data recorder with wires, but Ulanovsky wants his bats to fly. He and colleagues designed a lightweight, miniature data logger small enough to mount atop a bat’s head. The recorder, which connects to the tiny implanted wires, wirelessly transmits its readings to Ulanovsky’s computer. “This allows us to get closer to the natural behavior,” he says.\\nUlanovsky asks how the firing patterns of neurons match up with the free-flying bats’ actions. In a handful of papers published since 2007, he and colleagues have identified key types of navigational neurons that scientists had also seen in rats, like place cells that fire when a bat is in a particular spot. Another type of cell, called grid cells, seems to work via an imaginary mental grid the brain lays over the real environment(SN Online: 8/5/13). These cells activate when a bat crosses the grid lines. Other neurons turn on when a bat’s head is at a particular angle. “We found them all in bats, just like in rodents,” Ulanovsky says. Those findings, though satisfying, told only half the story, he says: how a bat understands where it is at any given time. But what if the bat has a goal destination in mind, too? “We had an understanding of how point A is represented, but not point B,” he says. “It has been a big missing link.”\\nIn experiments reported in January in Science, Ulanovsky’s team identified hippocampal neurons responsible for keeping track of target destinations in Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), pointy-eared critters with doglike faces that use echolocation to find tasty fruits and nectar.\\nThe researchers trained the bats to fly around a room to a banana reward, which was sometimes hidden behind a curtain. In one experiment, the team placed wire probes in the hippocampus of three bats, eavesdropping on a total of 309 neurons in the vicinity of the electrodes. Of those, 58 fired when a bat was at certain angles to its goal and 49 fired when it was certain distances from its goal. Twenty-four of the neurons responded to both angle and distance. With input from those three types of neurons, the bat’s brain kept track of the location of the treat.\\n“It’s an exciting and important study,” says Hugo Spiers, a neuroscientist at University College London who studies navigation in people and rats. “How cells in the hippocampus might provide guidance signals has been very underinvestigated.” Spiers is now looking for similar goal-directed neurons in rats. People probably have neurons similar to those reported by Ulanovsky, Spiers adds.\\nActions and reactions\\nBefore starting his group at the Weizmann Institute, Ulanovsky learned about bats in the lab of Cynthia Moss, now Kothari’s adviser at Johns Hopkins. Moss focuses on an area on the surface of the brain, the midbrain superior colliculus. Like the hippocampus, the superior colliculus also maps a bat’s environment, but there’s a difference. The hippocampus makes a map of environmental features with respect to each other; no matter where the bat is, it keeps the same basic mental map. The superior colliculus generates a map of the world with the bat at the center, so the map changes as the animal moves.\\nThe superior colliculus links what an animal perceives with how it moves in response. In an eyesight-favoring animal like a human, that might mean turning the head or shifting gaze to get a better look at the sudden movement of an oncoming car or a zooming baseball. For bats, one role of the superior colliculus is to help the bat orient itself to sounds, such as the echoes of its own calls.\\nMost studies of animal sensory processing, including Moss’ past work, involve restrained animals. Studies might also use speakers emitting calls and echoes to create a sort of “virtual reality” for bats instead of using their natural calls and echoes, Moss notes. For more than a decade, she’s been working toward the experiments Kothari and postdoctoral researcher Melville Wohlgemuth recently performed in her high-tech bat room. Moss’ group is among the first to look at how neurons in the superior colliculus respond to the auditory world, in three dimensions, while an animal is freely moving.\\nMoss and her team study big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), which, in fact, are “not very big,” Moss says. They’re a bit smaller than the average hamster, though their wingspan is a foot long. In the wild, these bats nosh on beetles and other small insects. Measuring the precise distance to an insect meal, with both predator and prey aloft, is a crucial life skill.\\nAs the bats flew their oatmeal-container obstacle course, and another that required them to find a hole in a net, Kothari and Wohlgemuth recorded neuron activity, with sensors similar to Ulanovsky’s. But to match specific neurons with what the bats were doing and perceiving, the scientists needed to know what calls the animals produced, and what echoes the animals heard. That’s where the microphones around the room come in.\\nThe researchers took advantage of the fact that echolocation is a back and forth between a bat and its world. The bat can tune the direction and rate of its calls, depending on what it’s investigating. So the scientists, eavesdropping with ultrasonic microphones, can infer what the bats are homing in on, as if the animals are broadcasting, for example, “I’m focusing in on this yummy mealworm on my right.” Then, the researchers used computer software to predict what echoes would come back to the bat. (Putting mikes on the bats’ heads would be too heavy for the lightweight fliers, and probably not sensitive enough to pick up those echoes, anyway.)\\nMoss and colleagues predicted that certain neurons would respond to the angle an echo returned from, as well as to the time delay, which indicates the distance of the sound-reflecting object. Indeed, of 119 neurons the researchers managed to monitor from two big brown bats, 41 fired in response to an echo returning at particular angles and distances from the animal. Those neurons were helping the bats localize objects in three-dimensional space.\\nDuring their flights, the bats sometimes sent out sonar sound groups, rapid clusters of echolocation calls. Moss had hypothesized that these clusters help bats get better spatial resolution to really focus on the objects of greatest interest. That’s important, for instance, when navigating a dense forest or cluttered room. The new study, not yet published, supports the idea.\\nThe bats seem to use the clusters to narrow interest to objects a certain distance away, which the bats can measure by the time delay between their call and the returning echo. The farther away something is, the longer the delay. When the bats were just doing normal, nonclustered echolocation, a given neuron that fires for an eight-millisecond echo delay would also respond to a range of echo times — say, any time between four and 12 milliseconds, Moss explains. But when the bats emitted clustered calls, the same neuron would respond only to echoes coming in at a delay close to eight milliseconds. The bats were fine-tuning their brains so they could get a better, sharper impression of the most interesting objects, she says.\\nThe value of the study lies in the observations in untethered animals, says Shihab Shamma, a neuroscientist and engineer at the University of Maryland in College Park who studies sound processing in ferrets. “This one is more natural,” he says. “That’s really cool, to actually see what the processing is in the brain,” Shamma says.\\nBecause the circuitry of the superior colliculus is common across mammals, Kothari predicts that similar 3-D processing of space occurs in humans and other primates, too.\\nFrom all directions\\nThese latest findings with untethered bats broaden understanding of how animals navigate. But the researchers are well aware that each study focuses on only a small part of a larger process. For example, what happens after a navigation-related neuron in the superior colliculus or hippocampus fires? How does the brain turn neuron firing into a map of its world or a decision to move from here to there? “Very little is known,” Ulanovsky says.\\nRazak, at UC Riverside, has an idea about how the firing of certain neurons gets interpreted, though it’s only a hypothesis. He studies echolocation as well as direct listening for environmental sounds in a group of bat species called gleaning bats. They’re also called whispering bats because they emit quiet echolocation calls as they fly along, ears cocked for the rustles of insect prey on the ground.\\nSpecifically, Razak works with gleaners known as pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus), because of their white bellies, which Razak suspects might offer camouflage from the gaze of insects looking upward. Pallid bats are remarkably good at pinpointing the location of a sound, with an accuracy of 3 to 4 degrees, Razak says. Humans appear to be better at this task, able to tell the difference between sounds separated by just 1 to 2 degrees. But we have the advantage of several inches between our two ears, making it easier to triangulate the source of sound. “If you normalize to head size, the bat is a champion,” Razak says.\\nHe studies the auditory cortex, an outer part of the brain involved in hearing and interpreting sounds. In his previous research, Razak reported how certain cortex neurons, in anesthetized bats, respond to sounds coming in from different angles in a horizontal semicircle in front of the animal. In a 2015 report in the Journal of Neuroscience, he started to explain how bats determine the vertical angle to dinner.\\nThere are two overlapping maps in the cortex, one for horizontal and one for vertical angles. For the horizontal angle, one group of neurons fires when a sound comes in from directly in front of the bat’s nose. Other groups respond to sounds to the left or the right of the animal. The auditory cortex on the right side of the brain responds to sounds in what Razak refers to as the left “hemifield” — anywhere to the left side of the head. The more right-brain neurons are firing, the more directly to the left the sound is. The same thing happens on the left side of the bat’s brain, for sounds on the right.\\nA second map indicates the vertical angle. A few neurons fire for sounds that are coming in low, and more fire for sounds coming in from a higher elevation. To decode those signals, Razak hypothesizes, there could be some as-yet-undefined “comparer” that integrates the information from the two maps. If the comparer is getting mostly straight-ahead signals, it knows the sound is coming from dead in front of the bat’s nose. If it’s getting mostly right hemifield signals from the left side of the brain, it can deduce that the sound is coming from somewhere to the right side of the head, at a range of horizontal or vertical angles to the ear. If it’s hearing a lot of that input from the right side of the brain, then the sound is on the left.\\nThis theory is the first idea proposed for how the auditory cortex of any animal understands the location of an object at both horizontal and vertical angles, Razak says. He’s now designing experiments to test this idea and search for the comparer.\\nTaken together, these studies are beginning to paint a picture of what goes on in the brain as a bat perceives and moves through its environment. But there’s still plenty of uncertainty about the bat brain and how well it matches to what the human brain does. “These are still big questions: How do we make sounds and how does our brain control what we make? How do we develop the sense of localization?” says Razak. “The bats continue to offer some interesting insight.”\\nWhat’s already certain is that the flying creatures have earned the respect of the scientists working with them. After all, Moss notes, the big brown bat’s brain is the size of a lima bean, but still manages to process sounds in a way human sonar engineers envy.\\n\\n                                                                                                                        0.298645\n",
      "﻿José Dinneny wants us to see plants as stranger things.\\n“They’re able to integrate information and make coherent decisions without a nervous system, without a brain,” he points out. Plus, plants find water without sight or touch. For too many of us, however, lawns, salads and pots on a sunny windowsill make plants so familiar we’ve become blind to how exotic they are.\\n“We’re out searching the solar system and the galaxy for extraterrestrial life,” says Dinneny, 39, “and we have aliens on our own planet.”\\nThe thrill of discovering plants’ alien ways drives Dinneny to explore how roots search for water. His research group, at the Carnegie Institution for Science labs in Stanford, Calif., “runs on curiosity,” he says.\\nHis work could have practical food security and geopolitical consequences. Dinneny is passionate about the molecular whys and hows of regulating plant growth. From a background in basic plant development, he moved to questions of environmental stress. These questions are important in “this huge crisis we face as a species,” says Jonathan Lynch, a root biologist at Penn State and the University of Nottingham in England. Knowing how to grow plants in environments degraded by climate change will be crucial to feeding an exploding human population.\\nLynch calls Dinneny “one of these transitional characters, very important in science.” He builds bridges between the pure molecular biologists and the more agricultural plant biologists, “people like me who think about specific plants,” Lynch says. The two groups rarely mingle and focus on different goals and priorities, Lynch says. He remembers a 2015 workshop on plant development and drought stress that Dinneny helped organize: “People were standing up and shouting.”\\nTo add a touch more agricultural realism to molecular root research, Dinneny and colleagues have developed a new alternative to the typical seedlings in petri dishes. The system, called GLO-Roots, makes roots in soil easier to watch. Plant roots induced to glow spread in slim sandwiches of soil between two clear plates, weaving among air pockets, micro rivers and clots of dirt. Computer analysis of images tracks where root tissues luminesce as various genes turn on in the twinkling underground observatory, giving researchers clues to how roots detect and respond to their environment.\\nThrusting out a side branch to seek out water turns out to be a local matter on a root, Dinneny and colleagues found using micro-CT scans of roots in soil. Analyzing hormones showed that the tissues can sense water differences on a scale of mere micrometers. The team described the basic development of what Dinneny calls “hydropatterning” in 2014 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\\n“Myself and many other people had studied lateral roots for many years,” says Malcolm Bennett of the University of Nottingham, who collaborated on the study. It was familiar to see seedlings forming roots mostly on the wet side. But Dinneny thought to ask how something so obvious was actually happening.\\nNow he and colleagues are probing deeper into the cellular machinery at work. Individual cells in the root need to be expanding to detect water, he and Carnegie colleague Neil E. Robbins II proposed online in January at bioRxiv.org.\\nPlants are very different from vertebrates, which develop while shielded in wombs or eggs. Root branching responds to outside triggers, heading toward life-sustaining reservoirs.\\nIn a different world, Dinneny says, his job might have been cooking plants instead of studying them. He can “make a mean potpie” and enjoys the nightly challenge of preparing a meal that his three children “find edible.” His maternal grandfather’s cooking in the 1950s at a resort in Acapulco, Mexico, impressed a visitor who hired his grandparents as at-home cook and maid. That meant a move to southern California, and eventually a chef position for the grandfather in a Los Angeles restaurant.\\n Dinneny spent much of his childhood in California’s San Fernando Valley. “I wasn’t tracked to do anything excellent at all,” he says of his school years. “I was placed in classes that weren’t particularly challenging.” In 10th grade, though, he took an Advanced Placement biology class and still remembers a pivotal moment when his teacher asked about a chemical bond in DNA. “I was the only person who raised his hand.” The answer: a phosphodiester bond. “Everyone looked around the room sort of wondering who could possibly have known that factoid,” he says.\\nHe was surprised himself, and began to realize he had a talent for understanding biology. He lobbied hard to transfer to advanced classes and began to apply himself to studying. He didn’t come from an academic family, but he had fine examples of working hard, including his single mother, a government accountant.\\n“Often we kind of cubbyhole ourselves into, ‘OK, I’m good at this,’ or ‘I’m not good at that.’ Or they’re doing well because they’re just inherently better at doing this than I am,’” he says. “There is a magical relationship between effort and success.” Not every goal gets met, but “you’re going to do better than you ever thought.”\\nBy his senior year, Dinneny was a straight A student headed to University of California, Berkeley. There, a holistic approach to plant science captivated him. For his Ph.D., at the University of California, San Diego, he studied the genetics of plant development, then moved to studying plants under environmental stress.\\nDeep-sea creatures and ocean exploring had captivated him for much of his childhood. But plants have turned out to be strange enough.\\n\\n

      "﻿Discoveries about the molecular ups and downs of fruit flies’ daily lives have won Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbashand Michael W. Young the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.\\nThese three Americans were honored October 2 by the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm for their work in discovering important gears in the circadian clocks of animals. The trio will equally split the 9 million Swedish kronor prize — each taking home the equivalent of $367,000.\\nThe researchers did their work in fruit flies. But “an awful lot of what was subsequently found out in the fruit flies turns out also to be true and of huge relevance to humans,” says John O’Neill, a circadian cell biologist at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England. Mammals, humans included, have circadian clocks that work with the same logic and many of the same gears found in fruit flies, say Jennifer Loros and Jay Dunlap, geneticists at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College.\\nCircadian clocks are networks of genes and proteins that govern daily rhythms and cycles such as sleep, the release of hormones, the rise and fall of body temperature and blood pressure, as well as other body processes. Circadian rhythms help organisms, including humans, anticipate and adapt to cyclic changes of light, dark and temperature caused by Earth’s rotation. When circadian rhythms are thrown out of whack, jet lag results. Shift workers and people with chronic sleep deprivation experience long-term jet lag that has been linked to serious health consequences including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, obesity and depression.\\nBefore the laureates did their work, other scientists had established that plants and animals have circadian rhythms. In 1971, Seymour Benzer and Ronald Konopka (both now deceased and ineligible for the Nobel Prize) found that fruit flies with mutations in a single gene called period had disrupted circadian rhythms, which caused the flies to move around at different times of day than normal.\\n“But then people got stuck,” says chronobiologist Erik Herzog of Washington University in St. Louis. “We couldn’t figure out what that gene was or how that gene worked.”\\nAt Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., Hall, a geneticist, teamed up with molecular biologist Rosbash to identify the period gene at the molecular level in 1984. Young of the Rockefeller University in New York City simultaneously deciphered the gene’s DNA makeup. “In the beginning, we didn’t even know the other group was working on it, until we all showed up at a conference together and discovered we were working on the same thing,” says Young. “We said, ‘Well, let’s forge ahead. Best of luck.’”  \\n\\n

      "﻿After 20 years in space and 13 years orbiting Saturn, the veteran spacecraft spent its last 90 seconds or so firing its thrusters as hard as it could to keep sending Saturnian secrets back to Earth for as long as possible.\\nThe spacecraft entered Saturn’s atmosphere at about 3:31 a.m. PDT on September 15 and immediately began running through all of its stabilizing procedures to try to keep itself upright. The signal that Cassini had reached its destination arrived at Earth at 4:54 a.m., and cut out about a minute later as the spacecraft lost its battle with Saturn’s atmosphere.\\n“The signal from the spacecraft is gone, and within the next 45 seconds, so will be the spacecraft,” Cassini project manager Earl Maize announced from the mission control center at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab. “I hope you’re all as deeply proud of this amazing accomplishment. Congratulations to you all. This has been an incredible mission, an incredible spacecraft, and you’re all an incredible team. I’m going to call this the end of mission. Project manager, off the net.”\\nWith that, the mission control team erupted in applause, hugs and some tears.\\nIt’s the end of an era. But the spacecraft’s last moments at Saturn will answer questions that couldn’t have been addressed any other way.\\nGoing out in a blaze of glory seems fitting. Since its launch in 1997, the probe traveled a total of 7.9 billion kilometers. It gathered more than 635 gigabytes of science data and took more than 450,000 images. It completed 294 orbits of Saturn, discovered six named moons and made 162 close, deliberate flybys of the ringed planet’s largest and most interesting moons.\\nThe last flyby sealed Cassini’s fate. On September 11, at 12:04 p.m., Cassini passed by Saturn’s largest moon Titan one last time (SN Online: 9/11/17). The moon’s gravity nudged Cassini on an irretrievable trajectory into the giant planet’s atmosphere.\\nAlso blame the moons — particularly lake-dappled Titan and watery Enceladus — for why Cassini went out in such dramatic fashion. The mission team decided to sacrifice the spacecraft when it ran out of fuel, rather than risk a collision with one of those potentially habitable moons and contaminating it with any still-lingering earthly microbes.\\n“Because of planetary protection and our desire to go back to Enceladus, go back to Titan, go back to the Saturn system, we must protect those bodies for future exploration,” Jim Green, director of NASA’s planetary science division, said at a news conference on September 13.\\nEven in its months-long death spiral, Cassini collected unprecedented observations. Starting in April, the spacecraft made 22 dives through the unexplored region between Saturn and its rings. Measurements of the gravity and composition in that zone will help solve outstanding mysteries. How long is Saturn’s day? How much material is in the rings? When and how did the rings form?\\nTo answer that last question in particular, “you have to fly between the planet and the rings,” says planetary scientist Matthew Hedman of the University of Idaho in Moscow, who uses Cassini data to study the rings. “That’s risky. We had to wait until the end of the mission to take that risk.”\\nOn September 13 and 14, Cassini took a last look around the Saturn system’s greatest hits, taking a color mosaic image of Saturn and the rings, a movie sequence of Enceladus setting behind Saturn, Titan and tiny moonlets in the rings that pull the icy ring particles around themselves to form features called propellers.\\nInside the mission control center on the afternoon of September 14, a hushed operations team waited for Cassini to come online for the last time to start sending the last pictures back (SNOnline: 9/15/17).  Then flight engineer Michael Staab at JPL suddenly broke the silence.  “Yeah!” he yelled, pumping both arms in the air. Cassini’s last signal had just come in.\\n“That tells us that the spacecraft is nice and healthy, she’s doing just fine. She’s doing exactly what she’s supposed to do, like she’s done for 13 years,” Staab said. “We’re just gonna track her now, all the way in.”\\nIn the wee hours of September 15, the spacecraft reconfigured itself to shift from a recording device to a transmitting probe. As of that moment, its last and only job was to stream everything it could sense directly back to Earth in real time. Turning so that its ion neutral mass spectrometer was facing directly towards Saturn, Cassini could taste the atmosphere for the first time and investigate a phenomenon called “ring rain,” in which water and ice from the rings splash into the atmosphere. This idea was introduced in the early 1980s, but Cassini has already shown that it’s more complicated than previously thought.\\n“We’re trying to find out exactly what is coming from the rings and what is due to the atmosphere,” Hunter Waite, Cassini team lead for the mass spectrometer instrument and an atmospheric scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, said at the Sept. 13 news conference. “That final plunge will allow us to do that.”  \\nThat plunge happened at about 3:31 a.m., when Cassini entered the atmosphere about 10 degrees north of the equator, falling at around 34 kilometers per second. It took data constantly, directly measuring the temperature, magnetic field, plasma density and composition of the upper layers of Saturn’s atmosphere for the first time ever.\\nWhen it hit the atmosphere, Cassini started firing its thrusters to keep its antenna pointed at Earth despite the forces of the atmosphere trying to knock it askew. But about a minute later, the atmosphere won, when Cassini was about 1,400 kilometers above the cloud tops.\\nWhat happened next, scientists can only imagine. Models suggest this fiery demise: The spacecraft attempted to stabilize itself, but to no avail. It started to tumble faster and faster. Atmospheric friction broke the spacecraft apart, bit by bit — first its thermal blankets burned off, then aluminum components started to melt. The spacecraft probably fell another 1,000 kilometers as it disintegrated like a meteor, Maize said.\\nSaturn’s atmosphere crushed and melted the bits and pieces, until they completely dissociated and became part of the very planet the spacecraft had been sent to observe. \\nWhen all was said and done, the spacecraft lasted about 30 seconds longer than expected. That may help ensure the team got enough data to figure out Saturn’s rotation period, science team member Michele Dougherty of Imperial College London  said at a post-mission news conference September 15. “I’m hoping we can do it, I’m not going to promise. Ask me in three months’ time.”\\nThere are no planned future missions to Saturn, although some Cassini alumni are already working on proposals.\\nOuter solar system astronomers are now setting their sights on Jupiter and its icy, possibly life-friendly moons. The European Space Agency’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) and NASA’s Europa Clipper both hope to launch around 2022. Those missions may pave the way for a lander on Europa (SN Online: 2/18/17), which could directly look for life in that moon’s subsurface seas.\\nPlanetary scientist Kevin Hand at JPL, who is leading the science definition team for the proposed Europa lander, feels a debt to Cassini.\\n“When you’re at the earliest frontiers of exploration, it’s hard to feel sad,” he said. “The wake we’re experiencing right now for Cassini, it’s not so much an end but the early steps that pave the way for the next stage of exploration.”\\nEven Maize is more proud than mourning.\\n“This is exactly the way we always planned it. It’s sad that we’re losing this incredible discovery machine,” he said in the moments leading up to Cassini’s disintegration. “But the real sense here is just, all right, we got it!”\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.418666\n",
      "﻿Pluto has no rings — New Horizons triple-checked. An exhaustive search for rings and dust particles around the dwarf planet before, during and after the spacecraft flew past Pluto in 2015 has come up empty.\\n“It’s a very long paper to say we didn’t find anything,” says team member Tod Lauer of the analysis, posted online September 23 at arXiv.org. But the nonresult could help scientists understand the contents of the outer solar system — and help plan New Horizons’ next encounter. The spacecraft is now on a course to a space rock in the Kuiper Belt, another 1.5 billion kilometers past Pluto.\\nBefore New Horizons arrived at Pluto, the possible existence of rings was an urgent matter of safety. Hitting a particle as small as a sand grain could have damaged the spacecraft.\\nSearches with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2011 and 2012 turned up two previously unknown moonsorbiting Pluto — Kerberos and Styx (SN: 11/28/15, p. 14) — and zero rings. Even so, many researchers expected to encounter rings, or at least some debris. The four outer planets in the solar system have rings, as do other small bodies in the solar system, like the tiny planetoid 10199 Chariklo (SN: 5/3/14, p. 10). And some studies suggest that Pluto probably had rings at one point in its past, left over from the collision that formed its largest moon, Charon.\\nNine weeks before New Horizons’ closest approach to Pluto, a team jokingly called the “crow’s nest” acted much like a ship’s lookout for potential hazards, says Lauer, an astronomer with the National Optical Astronomy Observatory in Tucson, Ariz. The group examined images taken with the spacecraft’s Long Range Reconnaissance Imager camera, looking for ring particles reflecting sunlight or spots that moved against a starry background from one set of images to the next. Nothing turned up.\\nThe team declared the spacecraft’s trajectory safe, and New Horizons flew sailed safely past Pluto on July 14, 2015 (SN Online: 7/15/15). After the flyby, the team turned New Horizons around to look back at Pluto, and towards the sun. This was a much better position to look for rings, as dust particles would pop into view when backlit by the sun like motes of dust in the light from a window.\\n“If you really want to know for sure whether there’s any dust there, the viewing geometries where you’re looking past the dust with the sun in the background, that’s the gold standard,” says Matthew Tiscareno of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., who studied Saturn’s rings with the Cassini spacecraft but was not involved in New Horizons.\\nIt took the better part of a year for all the data from New Horizons to return to Earth, and several months after that to analyze it, but the team is now ready to call it: The rings really aren’t there — or at least they’re too diffuse to see.\\nThat’s somewhat surprising, Lauer says. But the chaotic gravity of Pluto’s family of moons might make it too hard for rings to find stable orbits. Or the slight pressure generated by light particles streaming from the sun could constantly blow would-be ring particles away.\\nIt’s also possible there just wasn’t that much dust there to begin with. New Horizons saw fewer craters on Pluto and Charon than expected, which could mean there are fewer small bodies at that distance from the sun smacking into Pluto and its moons and kicking up dust.\\nThat could be good news for New Horizons’ next act. After five months in hibernation, the spacecraft woke up on September 11 and has set its sights on a smaller, weirder and more distant object: a space rock about 30 kilometers long called 2014 MU69 (SN Online: 7/20/17). Initial observations suggest it might be a double object, with two bodies orbiting closely or touching lightly.\\nNew Horizons will fly past MU69 on January 1, 2019. In the meantime, the team is looking for hazards along the route. “We’re going to do a similar effort to what we did with Pluto,” Lauer says. “We’re going to get in the crow’s nest and get out our binoculars, as it were, and see if we’re going to be okay.”\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.385045\n",
      "﻿Haumea can do the hula-hoop. The egg-shaped dwarf planet is the first object beyond Neptune to be spotted sporting a ring of particles.\\n“It now appears that rings can be common in the outer solar system,” says Jose-Luis Ortiz of the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia in Granada, Spain.\\nOn January 21, Ortiz and colleagues used 12 telescopes at 10 observatories to peer into the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy objects beyond the orbit of Neptune, and watch Haumea block the light of a distant star. That tiny eclipse let the team measure the dwarf planet’s size, shape and surrounding environment more accurately than ever before.\\nHaumea turned out to be larger — its long axis stretches at least 2,322 kilometers, a bit more than half the width of the contiguous United States — and less dense than previously thought, the team reports October 11 in Nature. To their surprise, the researchers also saw the background star flicker before and after its light was blocked by Haumea itself. That flicker is consistent with a 70-kilometer-wide ring about 1,000 kilometers above the dwarf planet’s surface.\\nThe ring is probably made of rock and ice, Ortiz says, but more observations are needed to know for sure. It could be debris kicked up by impacts from small stray space rocks — or even just from the dwarf planet’s spinning. Haumea twirls unusually fast, completing a rotation once every 3.9 hours, which could help fling particles into orbit.\\nUntil recently, the four giant planets — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — were the only solar system bodies known to have rings. Then in 2014 and 2015, astronomers spotted rings around the tiny planetoids 10199 Chariklo (SN: 5/3/14, p. 10) and 2060 Chiron, suggesting that small bodies could hold on to rings, too.\\nBoth of those small worlds are known as centaurs, objects whose orbits take them between Jupiter and Neptune, although they may be interlopers from the more distant Kuiper Belt. Since recent searches for rings around Pluto came up empty (SN Online: 10/4/17), no object farther away than Neptune seemed to have rings. Some astronomers speculated that something about the Kuiper Belt disrupted rings around small worlds there, or that the centaurs got their rings as part of the process that kicked them into their current orbits. Haumea’s ring suggests that such structures can form and survive at the solar system’s fringes after all.\\n“This discovery does disrupt that tidy narrative,” says Matthew Tiscareno of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., who studies Saturn’s rings but was not involved in the new study. “Reality is more complicated — that is, interesting.”\\n\\n

      "﻿It’s not every day that a spacecraft gets vaporized by the very planet it sought to explore.\\nAfter 13 years studying Saturn and its moons, NASA’s Cassini spacecraft will plunge into the ringed gas giant’s atmosphere. The mission will come to a close at about 7:55 a.m. EDT (4:55 a.m. PDT) Friday, when Saturn’s atmosphere pushes Cassini’s antenna away from Earth, terminating the signal. Shortly thereafter, the spacecraft will disintegrate.\\nIf you want to keep tabs on the action, you’ve got a few options. Science News astronomy writer Lisa Grossman is at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. — home of mission control for the Cassini probe. She’ll be popping on to the Science News Facebook page throughout the day Thursday with live updates, and she (@astrolisa) and Science News (@ScienceNews) will have details for you on Twitter as well.\\nCassini’s death won’t be captured on film. But thanks to the internet, you can watch NASA scientists react to the probe’s impending doom live.  In the early hours of Friday morning (7-8:30 a.m. EDT/4-5:30 a.m. PDT), NASA plans to stream a live video feed from the control room, which you can watch here:\\nAnd, you can also watch on NASA JPL’s YouTube channel and NASA’s Facebook page.\\nFor more on Cassini’s exploits, check out all of our past coverage of the mission.\\n\\n

      "﻿Two ultradense cores of dead stars have produced a long-awaited cosmic collision, showering scientists with riches.\\nThe event was the first direct sighting of a smashup of neutron stars, which are formed when aging stars explode and leave behind a neutron-rich remnant. In the wake of the collision, the churning residue forged gold, silver, platinum and a smattering of other heavy elements such as uranium, researchers reported October 16 at a news conference in Washington, D.C. Such elements’ birthplaces were previously unknown, but their origins were revealed by the cataclysm’s afterglow.\\n“It really is the last missing piece” of the periodic table, says Anna Frebel, an astronomer at MIT who was not involved in the research. “This is heaven for anyone working in the field.” After the collision, about 10 times the Earth’s mass in gold was spewed out into space, some scientists calculated.\\nUsing data gathered by about 70 different observatories, astronomers characterized the event in exquisite detail, releasing a slew of papers describing the results. A tremor of gravitational waves, spotted by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, LIGO, on August 17, provided the first sign of the cataclysm.\\n“Already it is transforming our understanding of the universe, with a fresh narrative of the physics of stars in their death throes,” said France Córdova, director of the National Science Foundation, which funds LIGO.\\nA sequence of various types of electromagnetic radiation followed that gravitational trill, like musical instruments taking turns in a symphony. A burst of gamma rays segued into a glow of visible and infrared light, first spotted about 12 hours after the smashup. More than a week later, as those wavelengths faded away, X-rays crescendoed, followed by radio waves.\\nCombining gravitational waves with light from a neutron star merger is a long-held dream of astrophysicists. “The picture that you can put together by having all of those sources is synergistic,” says LIGO spokesperson David Shoemaker of MIT. “You can make inferences that otherwise would be impossible.\"\\nThat detailed picture revealed the inner workings of neutron star collisions and the source of brief blasts of high-energy light called short gamma-ray bursts. Researchers also calculated how fast the universe is expanding and tested the properties of the odd material within neutron stars.\\nFor astrophysicists, “this event is the Rosetta stone,” says LIGO member Richard O’Shaughnessy of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York.\\nLIGO’s two detectors, located in the United States, registered an unmistakable sign of the upheaval: A shimmying of space itself that continued for about 100 seconds before cutting off. It was the strongest and longest series of spacetime ripples LIGO had ever seen. At that point, scientists knew they had something big, says LIGO member Vicky Kalogera of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. “The e-mails that were circulated said, ‘Oh my God, this is it.’”\\nThat vibration was an indication of a cosmic crash: Whirling round each other as if on an ill-fated merry-go-round, two orbiting neutron stars spiraled closer and closer, until they converged. The neutron stars, whose masses were  between 1.17 and 1.60 times that of the sun, probably collapsed into a black hole, although LIGO scientists were unable to determine the stars' fate for certain. LIGO has previously spotted mergers of swirling black holes with masses tens of times that of the sun (SN Online: 9/27/17); the smaller masses of the orbiting duo pointed the finger at neutron stars. And because black holes aren’t expected to emit light, the fireworks show that followed solidified the case for neutron stars.\\nLIGO’s sister experiment in Italy, Advanced Virgo, saw only a faint signal. That relatively weak detection helped narrow down where the convulsion occurred to “a part of the sky that was a blind spot of Virgo,” Kalogera says. That constrained the site to within a region of about 30 square degrees in the southern sky.\\nJust 1.7 seconds after the gravitational wave signal, NASA’s Fermi space telescope spotted a glimmer of gamma rays in the same neighborhood of the sky. Meanwhile, other telescopes swung into action, picking up a glow where none had been before. “We saw what looked like a new star,” says astronomer Edo Berger of Harvard University, who led a team that spotted the light with the DECam on the Blanco telescope in Chile. Berger’s was one of several teams that observed the blast’s light. That detection pinpointed the galaxy NGC 4993, 130 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Hydra, as the collision site. “There was this moment of disbelief: Wow, we actually did it. We found it,” Berger says.\\nThat afterglow also revealed an amazing story of stellar alchemy: With the stars’ death came the birth of elements. As the collision spurted neutron-rich material into space, a bevy of heavy elements formed, through a chain of reactions called the r-process (SN: 5/14/16, p. 9). In this process, which requires an environment crammed with neutrons, atomic nuclei rapidly gobble up neutrons and decay radioactively, thereby transforming into new elements, before resuming their neutron gorgefest. The r-process is thought to produce about half of the elements heavier than iron.\\nScientists detected the characteristic glow of this process, called a kilonova, in follow-up observations. “Until this event, we had never directly seen anywhere in nature these heavy elements being forged. Now we have,” says Brian Metzger, a theoretical astrophysicist at Columbia University. “It is a feeling like you’ve discovered some kind of secret of nature.”\\nPreviously, astrophysicists disagreed about where the r-process occurs: Two top candidates were exploding stars called supernovas (SN: 2/18/17, p. 24) and neutron star mergers. Although scientists can’t yet say whether all r-process elements are produced in neutron star mergers, the amount such collisions should produce appears large enough to explain the abundances found in the universe.\\nAdditional riches were revealed by gamma rays. Scientists spotted a phenomenon called a short gamma-ray burst, a brief spurt of high-energy light, less than two seconds long. Such paroxysms are relatively common, appearing in the sky about 50 times a year. But finding their source is “a long-standing problem in astrophysics,” says theoretical astrophysicist Rosalba Perna of Stony Brook University in New York. The detection clinched it: Short gamma-ray bursts come from neutron star tête-à-têtes.\\nBy studying how the neutron stars spiraled inward, astrophysicists also tested the “squishiness” of neutron star material for the first time. This extreme substance is so dense that a teaspoonful of it would have a mass of around a billion metric tons, and scientists don’t fully understand how it responds when squeezed, a property known as its “equation of state.” Measuring this property could give scientists a better understanding of the strange material. Although the results couldn’t pin down whether the neutron stars were squishy, some theories that predicted ultrasquishy neutron stars were ruled out.\\nThe neutron stars’ union also gave researchers the opportunity to gauge the universe’s expansion rate, by measuring the distance of the collision using gravitational waves and comparing that to how much the wavelength of light from the galaxy was stretched by the expansion. Scientists have previously measured this property, known as the Hubble constant, through other means. But those measurements are in disagreement, leaving scientists scrambling to explain the discrepancy (SN: 8/6/16, p. 10).\\nNow, scientists have “a totally different, independent measurement,” says LIGO collaboration member Daniel Holz of the University of Chicago. The new measurement indicates that distantly separated galaxies are spreading apart at about 70 kilometers per second for each megaparsec between them. It falls squarely between the two previous estimates: 67 and 73 km/s per megaparsec. Though this collision can’t yet resolve the debate, future mergers could help improve the measurement.\\n“These are all just unbelievable, major advances,” Holz says. “It’s really been this insane thrill.”\\nThe excitement has yet to die down. Take it from astronomer Ryan Foley of the University of California, Santa Cruz, whose team was the first to spot visible light from the merger: “This is certainly the biggest discovery of my career and probably will be the biggest discovery of my entire life.”\\n\\n    0.247558\n",
      "﻿The tropics of Asia, Africa and South America all puffed out more carbon dioxide during the strong 2015–2016 El Niño than during the 2011 La Niña, new satellite data show. Because El Niño’s warmer, drier conditions in tropical regions mimic the effects of climate change expected by the end of the century, those observations may be a sobering harbinger of the tropics’ diminishing role as a buffer for fossil fuel emissions (SN Online: 9/28/17).\\nThe new findings come from NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, or OCO-2, which launched in 2014. Five papers in the Oct. 13 Science describe some of the first data collected by the satellite, which is giving scientists an unprecedented peek into how carbon moves between land, atmosphere and oceans.\\nAtmospheric scientist Junjie Liu of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and her colleagues report that the tropics of Asia, Africa and South America together released about 2.5 gigatons more carbon into the atmosphere in 2015 than they did in 2011, a cooler and wetter La Niña year. For comparison, the United States released 6.59 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere in 2015.\\nThe cause of those anomalies varied by region, the researchers discovered when they looked more closely at OCO-2 and other satellite data showing changes in biological productivity, carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere and other measurements. In Asia, an increase in biomass burning was primarily responsible for the extra carbon release.\\nBut the carbon bumps in Africa and South America were attributable to El Niño, the researchers report: In Africa, higher temperatures drove the larger release of carbon by increasing the rate of plant respiration. In South America, lower precipitation, which reduces the growth of plants, was largely responsible. Both conditions mimic climate changes expected to occur by the end of the century.\\n\\n

      "﻿By early next spring, astronomer David Kipping hopes to know if the object he’s spent his early career searching for is really there.\\nAn astronomer at Columbia University, Kipping is perhaps most known for a project sifting through data from the Kepler space telescope on more than a thousand planets orbiting distant stars. But he’s more interested in their moons. A moon could be a home to alien life even if its planet is inhospitable (SN: 2/9/13, p. 5). A moon could also make its host planet more likely to harbor life. Some models suggest that the presence of our moon might have helped make Earth a nice place to live. The same could be true for other moon-planet partnerships.\\nSo Kipping’s search, dubbed the Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler, gets at the fundamental nature of our place in the universe: Are we alone?\\nIn late October, Kipping and colleagues will use the Hubble Space Telescope to find out if they’ve caught their first quarry. The possible candidate is a Neptune-sized object orbiting the planet Kepler 1625b (SN: 8/19/17, p. 15). If the candidate turns out to be a genuine exomoon — Kipping is quick to point out that similar hints have fizzled before — he will no doubt solidify his reputation as “the moon guy.”\\nBut he dabbles in a lot of things. “I write a lot of failed papers,” he admits. He arrived at exomoons by following a simple philosophy: No idea is too crazy.\\n“His signature projects are quite risky, but with obvious large payback,” says Dimitar Sasselov, director of the Harvard Origins of Life Initiative, who worked with Kipping in his postdoc research at Harvard University.\\nKipping, now 33, grew up in a small town in England. He loved Star Trek, wanted to be an astronaut and memorized the names and masses of all the planets in the solar system — and their moons.\\nSupportive teachers encouraged him to pursue a career in physics at a time when exoplanet research was just starting to be taken seriously. By 2003, when he was an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, there were a few dozen known exoplanets. But there are 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. “It felt like there was a huge wave of discovery waiting to happen,” Kipping says.\\nSix years later, NASA launched Kepler and within five years, the number of known exoplanets ballooned to well over 1,000.\\nAll the planets Kepler has picked up made themselves known by blocking their star’s light as they crossed, or transited, in front of the star. Those transits produce a characteristic U-shape in graphs of starlight over time. As a graduate student at University College London, Kipping considered what the U-shaped graphs might reveal about the planets. Researchers already knew that deeper U’s mean larger planets, for example. More frequent U’s mean shorter orbital periods.\\nWhile staring at the stars on a hiking trip in the Himalayas, Kipping thought of something else that could change the U. “It was just obvious to me that a moon could screw it up,” he says. A large enough moon would create an occasional extra dip in the light.\\nIn the early days of the exoplanet boom, actually looking for such dips in the Kepler data was an audacious notion. But Kipping jumped in anyway. “I assumed it would be a tiny effect, but it turned out to be detectable,” Kipping says. His paper, published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in 2009, pointed out that Kepler could be used to search for exomoons, too.\\nTo pursue the search in earnest, Kipping taught himself new data processing techniques. The problem proved so computationally intensive that he turned to crowdfunding to buy a supercomputer while a postdoc at Harvard. His hunt caught on in the popular press, with write-ups in Time magazine and Wired. And other scientists joined the chase as well, with several more groups announcing competing searches in the past few years.\\nThere’s a reason Kipping’s team has found only one exomoon candidate so far: There aren’t many out there big enough for Kepler to see, according to his statistical work. “Because he’s doing such a careful job, it probably means something,” Sasselov adds. The systems the team has checked that show no moons most likely aren’t hiding any.\\nAs a new faculty member at Columbia, Kipping has lately turned his attention to teaching, mentoring and outreach. Many of his students say he supports their wildest pursuits — even those outside astronomy, like machine learning or linguistics.\\n“He’s known for out-there ideas,” says current graduate student Moiya McTier, who first worked with Kipping as an undergrad student in the Banneker Institute at Harvard, a program to prepare students of color for careers in astronomy. “Which is great, because I don’t feel afraid of going to him with my own crazy ideas.”\\nKipping’s latest experiment is a YouTube channel aimed at nonscientists. “Outreach isn’t really rewarded in the academic world,” he says. “It’s a thing I wouldn’t have done as a postdoc, but felt it was a risk I was willing to take as a faculty member.”\\nIt has paid unexpected scientific dividends already. While preparing a video about the Breakthrough Starshot initiative, which aims to send tiny spacecraft at 20 percent the speed of light to visit the nearest star to the sun (SN: 9/2/17, p. 4), Kipping realized there was an error in the Breakthrough team’s calculations of the photon pressure needed to propel the craft. The error connected back to Albert Einstein’s 1905 paper about special relativity and came from some assumptions made for simplicity that wouldn’t hold in real life.\\nKipping’s paper discussing the error was published in June in the Astronomical Journal.\\n“I would never have written a paper about special relativity if I hadn’t been doing outreach about Starshot,” he says. His philosophy makes more sense every year: Let all the crazy in. You never know where it will lead.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0.223660\n",
      "﻿The gravitational wave paparazzi have tracked down the cosmic neighborhood of two merging black holes. Scientists pinpointed the region in the sky where the two black holes violently melded and kicked up swirls of the spacetime ripples, locating their stomping grounds more precisely than ever before.\\nResearchers from LIGO — the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory — and its sister experiment, Advanced Virgo, spotted the ripples on August 14. The team announced the finding September 27 at a news conference at a meeting of the G7 science ministers in Turin, Italy, and in a paper accepted in Physical Review Letters.\\nIt’s the first gravitational wave sighting to be made with three detectors: LIGO’s two detectors (in Livingston, La., and Hanford, Wash.) and Virgo’s detector near Pisa, Italy. “The three-detector network really opens up a new potential and we are going to make the most of that potential in the future,” said Virgo scientist Frédérique Marion, of the Laboratoire d’Annecy de Physique des Particules in France.\\nThe trio of detectors allowed scientists to trace the source of the waves to a spot in the sky with an area of just 60 square degrees. Viewed in the night sky, the size of that region is about 300 times that of the full moon as seen from Earth. The ripples journeyed to Earth from about 1.8 billion light-years away, in a region near the constellation Eridanus in the southern sky.\\nLIGO has previously detected three black hole crashes with its two detectors; in each case, scientists carved out a swath of sky from which the waves could have come, but could not discern a more specific cosmic birthplace. The newfound black holes were located within a region about a tenth the size of those associated with previous detections.\\nBecause gravitational waves take time to complete the cross-planet jaunt from one detector to another, the three detectors spotted the signal at slightly different times. LIGO’s Livingston detector saw the waves first, followed by the LIGO Hanford detector 8 milliseconds later, and by the Virgo detector another 6 milliseconds after that. By analyzing these delays and the patterns of the ripples each detector saw, scientists were able to deduce what direction they came from.\\nScientists estimated the colliding black holes’ masses at about 31 and 25 times the sun’s mass. During the collision, approximately three solar masses were converted into energy and radiated as gravitational waves, leaving behind a 53-solar-mass black hole.\\nThe LIGO and Virgo detectors teamed up August 1 (SN Online: 8/1/17), when Virgo began officially taking data for the first time in its current, upgraded form. Previous incarnations of both LIGO and Virgo ran for years without detecting a whiff of spacetime wiggles. Now the detectors are finally sensitive enough to pick up the tiny tremors. The improved trio operated in tandem until August 25, when the detectors shut down for further improvements.\\nVirgo also allowed scientists to better test Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Because Virgo’s detector isn’t oriented parallel to the LIGO detectors, scientists could study the polarization of the waves  — the specific pattern by which they stretch and squeeze spacetime — for the first time. “In the long run that’s a really big deal,” says physicist Clifford Will of the University of Florida in Gainesville, who was not involved with the detection. If unexpected kinds of stretching or squeezing were found, “it would kill general relativity, just like that. That would be the end.” But Einstein’s theory held its ground.\\nScouting out the locales where black hole pairs live allows astronomers to look for light produced in the collision. Although most scientists expect that no light will be emitted in black hole dust-ups, some theories suggest otherwise. After the ripples were detected, telescopes scoured the spot, but observations came up empty.\\nOther kinds of collisions, however — between two remnants of stars called neutron stars — could produce light. Therefore, the new detection “is good preparation for what's to come,”  says physicist Emanuele Berti of the University of Mississippi in Oxford, who was not involved with the detection. Spotting light from a neutron star pileup could help scientists learn more about the extremely dense material that makes up neutron stars. In August, rumors began flying that scientists had detected such an event (SN Online: 8/25/17). If the rumor is true, Berti says, with two detections in one month, “they’ve made giant strides.”\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0.217018\n",
      "﻿The reappearance of a long-lost meteor shower has finally explained what happened to a missing comet named 289P/Blanpain.\\nThat comet was spotted only once in 1819 and never again, unusual for a body orbiting the sun. But in 2003, astronomers found a small asteroid moving along the Blanpain orbit, suggesting the space rock might be the comet (or a piece of it) after it ejected much of its cometary dust.\\nSome of that dust may have been what Japanese researchers saw in 1956 when they observed a meteor shower from the constellation Phoenix. Meteor showers occur when dust left behind by a comet burns up as it hits Earth’s atmosphere. Those “Phoenicid” meteors hadn’t been seen before — or since.\\nAstronomer Jun-ichi Watanabe of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan in Tokyo and colleagues traced the meteors to where the comet’s dust trail should have been. In 2010, the group predicted that the remaining dust would create another shower in 2014.\\nTeam members traveled to North Carolina and Spain’s Canary Islands to test their prediction, and on the first two days of December, 2014, they saw Phoenicids streak across the sky. But there were about 90 percent fewer meteors than expected; Blanpain may have lost its dust more quickly than previously thought, the team reports in the Sept. 1 Planetary and Space Science. The astronomers will get a second chance to check — another shower is expected in 2019.\\n\\n

      "﻿The world’s tropical forests are exhaling — and it’s not a sigh of relief. Instead of soaking up climate-warming gases on balance, these so-called “lungs of the planet” are beginning to release them.\\nA new study based on analyses of satellite imagery of tropical Asia, Africa and the Americas suggests that tropical forests contribute more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than they remove. Much of that carbon contribution is due to deforestation, the conversion of forests to urban spaces such as farms or roads. But more than two-thirds comes from a less visible source: a decline in the number and diversity of trees in remaining forests, researchers report online September 28 in Science.\\nTropical forests are a bulwark against rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, taking up carbon and storing it as stems, leaves and roots. Deforestation’s effect is clear; it cuts the number of trees that take up CO2. But even seemingly intact forests can be degraded or disturbed by selective logging, environmental change, wildfires or disease.\\nUnlike deforestation, which is easy to see in satellite images, these other kinds of degradation can be hard to spot, says study lead author Alessandro Baccini, a forest ecologist and remote sensing specialist at the Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth, Mass. A degraded forest still looks like forest — it’s just less dense, containing less carbon biomass.\\n“Carbon density is a weight,” Baccini says. “The problem is that there is no satellite in space that can give an estimate of weight.”\\nSo Baccini and his colleagues devised their own. First, they came up with a way to calibrate satellite images of the tropics using field observations and NASA Light Detection and Ranging Data, or lidar. Then, they created an algorithm that compares 500-meter-square parcels of each image from each year from 2003 to 2014 to calculate gains and losses in carbon density.\\nIn total, the researchers found, tropical forests emit 862 teragrams of carbon to the atmosphere annually — more than all cars in the United States did in 2015 — and absorb only 436 teragrams of carbon each year. Of that net loss of carbon to the atmosphere, 69 percent is from degraded forests and the rest from deforestation.\\nSome 60 percent of those carbon emissions came from tropical America, including the Amazon Basin. Africa’s tropical forests were responsible for about 24 percent of the carbon loss, and Asia’s forests for 16 percent.\\nThe results are a wake-up call that there is an opportunity for improvement, says study coauthor Wayne Walker, also a forest ecologist and remote sensing specialist at Woods Hole Research Center. “Forests are low-hanging fruit. Maintaining forests intact, and attempting to restore forests where they might have been lost, is relatively straightforward and inexpensive.”\\nNancy Harris, the research manager of the forest program at the World Resources Institute in Washington, D.C., also sees opportunity in these findings. “We’ve known for a long time that forest degradation is happening, but haven’t had a good way to measure it,” Harris says. “This paper goes a long way to capturing it in an empirical way.”\\nBut terrestrial ecosystem scientist Joshua Fisher of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., notes that this forest biomass study doesn’t fully gel with atmospheric observations of carbon emissions from tropical forests, which still show that the forests are taking up more carbon than they are emitting overall. That may be because the new study focuses on aboveground biomass and doesn’t include what’s absorbed in soils, he says.\\nStill, Fisher says, the study shows how important it is to include forest degradation as well as deforestation in studies of climate change. “It’s a good first step for future analyses,” he adds.\\n\\n

      "﻿A new discovery is turning the hemispheric history of a mysterious whale species upside-down. Two fossils recently unearthed in Italy and Japan suggest that a southern whale was briefly a denizen of northern waters more than half a million years ago.\\nUntil now, all available evidence suggested that the pygmy right whale, Caperea marginata, and its ancestors have been steadfast Southern Hemisphere residents for the past 10 million years.\\nPygmy right whales are so rarely sighted that scientists know very little about their lifestyle, and the fossil record is sparse, too. The new Northern Hemisphere fossils both closely resemble other confirmed specimens of the whales, researchers report October 9 in Current Biology. The fossils include a fragmented skull with ear bones dating to 0.5 to 0.9 million years ago, and a bone containing parts of the middle and inner ear that’s 1.7 million to 1.9 million years old.\\nGlaciation near the South Pole during the Pleistocene Ice Age may have temporarily pushed Capereafurther north, the researchers propose. Then, as the glaciers melted, the whale migrated south again. Because the new fossils are separated in age by about a million years, it’s hard to say whether the whales crossed the equator multiple times or briefly established a longer-term population in the Northern Hemisphere.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.462190\n",
      "﻿A boy who lived in what’s now South Africa nearly 2,000 years ago has lent a helping genome to science. Using the long-gone youngster’s genetic instruction book, scientists have estimated that humans emerged as a distinct population earlier than typically thought, between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago.\\nThe trick was retrieving a complete version of the ancient boy’s DNA from his skeleton to compare with DNA from people today and from Stone Age Neandertals and Denisovans. Previously documented migrations of West African farmers to East Africa around 2,000 years ago, and then to southern Africa around 1,500 years ago, reshaped Africans’ genetics — and obscured ancient ancestry patterns — more than has been known, the researchers report online September 28 in Science.\\nThe ancient boy’s DNA was not affected by those migrations. As a result, it provides the best benchmark so far for gauging when Homo sapiens originated in Africa, evolutionary geneticist Carina Schlebusch of Uppsala University in Sweden and her colleagues conclude.\\nIn line with the new genetically derived age estimate for human origins, another team has proposed that approximately 300,000-year-old fossils found in northwestern Africa belonged to H. sapiens (SN: 7/8/17, p. 6). Some researchers suspect a skull from South Africa’s Florisbad site, dated to around 260,000 years ago, qualifies as H. sapiens. But investigators often place our species’ origins close to 200,000 years ago(SN: 2/26/05, p. 141). There is broad consensus that several fossils from that time represent H. sapiens.\\nDebate over the timing of human origins will continue despite the new evidence from the child, whose remains came from previous shoreline excavations near the town of Ballito Bay, says Uppsala University evolutionary geneticist and study coauthor Mattias Jakobsson. “We don’t know if early Homo sapiensfossils or the Florisbad individual were genetically related to the Ballito Bay boy,” he says.\\nThus, the precise timing of humankind’s emergence, and exact patterns of divergence among later human populations, remain unclear. Researchers have yet to retrieve DNA from fossils dating between 200,000 and 300,000 years old that either securely or possibly belong to H. sapiens.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0.370829\n",
      "﻿When it comes to some oddball fish, looks can be deceiving.\\nPolypterus, today found only in Africa, and its close kin have generally been considered some of the most primitive ray-finned fishes alive, thanks in part to skeletal features that resemble those on some ancient fish. Now a new analysis of fish fossils of an early polypterid relative called Fukangichthys unearthed in China suggests that those features aren’t so old. The finding shakes up the evolutionary tree of ray-finned fishes, making the group as a whole about 20 million to 40 million years younger than thought, researchers propose online August 30 in Nature.\\nRay-finned fishes named for the spines, or rays, that support their fins — are the largest group of vertebrates, making up about half of all backboned animals. They include 30,000 living species, such as gars, bowfins and salmon. The group was thought to originate about 385 million years ago, in the Devonian Period. But the new research, using 3-D CT scans of the previously discovered fossils, shifts the fishes’ apparent origin to the start of the Carboniferous Period some 360 million years ago, says study coauthor Matt Friedman, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\\nOne of the largest extinction events in Earth’s history marks the boundary between the Devonian and Carboniferous. “We know that many groups of backboned animals were hard hit by the event,” Friedman says. But after the massive die-off, ray-finned fishes popped up and, according to previous fossil evidence, their diversity exploded. The new finding “brings the origin of the modern ray-finned fish group in line with this conspicuous pattern that we see in the fossil record,” Friedman says. It suggests these vertebrates didn’t survive the event. They came after, then flourished.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.348885\n",
      "﻿As far as last meals go, squid isn’t a bad choice. Cephalopod remains appear to dominate the stomach contents of a newly analyzed ichthyosaur fossil from nearly 200 million years ago.\\nThe ancient marine reptiles once roamed Jurassic seas and commonly pop up in England’s fossil-rich coast near Lyme Regis. But a lot of ichthyosaur museum specimens lack records of where they came from, making their age difficult to place.\\nDean Lomax of the University of Manchester and his colleagues reexamined one such fossil. Based on its skull, they identified the creature as a newborn Ichthyosaurus communis. Microfossils of shrimp and amoeba species around the ichthyosaur put the specimen at 199 million to 196 million years old, the researchers estimate.\\nTiny hook structures stand out in the newborn’s ribs — most likely the remnants of prehistoric black squid arms. Another baby ichthyosaur fossil that lived more recently had a stomach full of fish scales. So the new find suggests a shift in the menu for young ichthyosaurs at some point in their evolutionary history, the researchers write October 3 in Historical Biology.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.344611\n",
      "﻿DNA of people who lived around 34,000 years ago reveals an especially lively social scene that may have been a key to humans’ evolutionary success.\\nMuch like hunter-gatherers today, ancient Eurasians married outside their home groups and formed webs of friends and in-laws vital for eventually building cities and civilizations, a new study suggests.\\nLong-gone hunter-gatherers lived in groups with few close relatives, thus limiting opportunities for inbreeding, say evolutionary geneticist Martin Sikora of the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen and his colleagues. It’s likely that adolescents of both sexes found mates in communities other than their own, fostering social ties among groups that might otherwise avoid or fight each other, the scientists conclude online October 5 in Science. Modern hunter-gatherers likewise find partners among nearby groups (SN: 4/9/11, p. 13).\\nSikora’s findings support a proposal that hunter-gatherer bands composed mainly of in-laws and unrelated individuals appeared by the late Stone Age and probably much earlier than that, says anthropologist Kim Hill of Arizona State University in Tempe, who did not participate in the new study. The emergence of in-laws boosted communication and social learning across groups, a prerequisite for creating civilizations.\\n“Hunter-gatherer social structure is apparently unique to humans and is the reason why we alone are so reliant on culture and have achieved the marvels of technology and human society,” Hill says.\\nThe new study undercuts a long-standing idea that Stone Age hunter-gatherers clustered among close kin, with men forming alliances and guarding home territories against competing groups, much as chimpanzees now do. If that’s true, then the spread of agriculture around 10,000 years ago may have been what led modern hunter-gatherers to develop extensive social networks.  But Sikora’s study “shows that modern humans already lived in socially fluid societies well before the origins of agriculture,” says anthropologist Andrea Migliano of University College London.\\nLiving in small, interacting groups consisting mainly of those who weren’t kin made sense for people roaming near-arctic parts of Europe and West Asia starting around 40,000 years ago, says paleoanthropologist and study coauthor Marta Mirazón Lahr of the University of Cambridge. Those hunter-gatherers had to forage over large areas to survive, and mate exchanges among groups minimized inbreeding, she contends.\\nSkeletons of four people buried at a Russian site called Sunghir provided DNA for the new analysis. These individuals include a man in his own grave and two preteens or early adolescents placed head-to-head in the same grave, near a piece of an adult’s upper leg bone filled with a red pigment. Both graves included fancy items such as ivory beads and spears, armbands and carvings. Researchers have excavated Sunghir intermittently since the 1950s.\\nNew radiocarbon dates for the human fossils and a mammoth bone found at the site provided a more precise date for the Sunghir burials than was previously available.\\nAncient DNA from the four Sunghir individuals includes parts of the sex chromosomes, indicating that all of them were male. Scientists had previously suspected that one of the Sunghir youngsters was a girl. Genetic comparisons found no signs of close biological kinship. No parent, grandparent, sibling, aunt, uncle, niece or nephew relationships turned up.\\nAn analysis of a largely complete set of genetic instructions from one Sunghir youngster suggested that he came from a population that split off around 38,000 years ago from direct ancestors of modern Europeans. That ancient Sunghir-related population was relatively small, with anywhere from about 160 to 900 procreating adults, the researchers estimate.\\nIn rough agreement with previous estimates for present-day Europeans and East Asians, Sunghir individuals inherited about 2.5 percent of their DNA from Neandertals, Sikora’s team finds. That interbreeding occurred around 55,000 years ago, the investigators calculate.\\nFurther cross-species flings around 36,000 years ago contributed nearly another 0.4 percent Neandertal DNA to the Sunghir group, they say.\\nSunghir people did not display genetic markers of inbreeding previously observed in Neandertal DNA (SN: 1/25/14, p. 17). Neandertals lacked mating networks like those of ancient humans, the researchers propose.\\n\\n    0.309085\n",
      "﻿Late Stone Age people got a grip thanks to honeybees. Northern Europeans attached a barbed bone point to a handle of some kind with a beeswax adhesive around 13,000 years ago, scientists say. The result: a fishing spear.\\nUsing beeswax glue to make tools was common in Africa as early as 40,000 years ago (SN: 8/25/12, p. 16). But this spear is the first evidence of its use in cold parts of Europe at a time toward the end of the Stone Age when the glaciers were receding, say archaeologist Michael Baales of LWL-Archӓologie für Westfalen in Olpe, Germany, and his colleagues.\\nWhere the beeswax came from remains a question. Honeybees may have pushed north into Europe from warmer, Mediterranean locales several thousand years earlier than previously thought, the researchers propose in the October Antiquity. Farmers in Southwest Asia and Europe acquired beeswax and probably honey as early as 9,000 years ago (SN: 12/12/15, p. 13).\\nOr Northern European hunter-gatherers may instead have obtained beeswax through trade networks extending to Mediterranean areas, Baales’ team says. Stone Age Eurasians formed group alliances over large areas (SN Online: 10/5/17).\\nNew chemical and microscopic analyses of the bone point, discovered in western Germany in the 1930s, identified beeswax mixed with crushed charcoal. Charcoal kept the beeswax from becoming brittle, the investigators suspect.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0.294294\n",
      "﻿Over the last 40 years, the number of kids and teens with obesity has skyrocketed worldwide. In 1975, an estimated 5 million girls and 6 million boys were obese. By 2016, those numbers had risen to an estimated 50 million girls and 74 million boys, according to a report published online October 10 in the Lancet. While the increase in childhood obesity has slowed or leveled off in many high-income countries, it continues to grow in other parts of the world, especially in Asia.\\nUsing the body mass index, a ratio of weight to height, of more than 30 million 5- to 19-year-olds, researchers tracked trends from 1975 to 2016 in five weight categories: moderate to severe underweight, mild underweight, healthy weight, overweight and obesity. The researchers defined obesity as having a BMI around 19 or higher for a 5-year-old up to around 30 or higher for a 19-year-old.\\nGlobally, more kids and teens — an estimated 117 million boys and 75 million girls — were moderately or severely underweight in 2016 than were obese. But the total number of obese children is expected to overtake the moderately or severely underweight total by 2022, the researchers say.\\nThe globalization of poor diet and inactivity is part of the problem, says William Dietz, a pediatrician at George Washington University in Washington D.C., who wrote a commentary that accompanies the study. Processed foods and sugary drinks have become widely available around the world. And urbanization, which also increased in the last four decades, tends to reduce physical activity, Dietz says.\\nWhile obesity rates for kids and teens have largely leveled off in most wealthy countries, those numbers continue to increase for adults. The findings in children are consistent with evidence showing a drop in the consumption of fast food among children and adults in the United States over the last decade, Dietz says. “Children are going to be much more susceptible to changes in caloric intake than adults.”\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.266149\n",
      "﻿Some dinosaurs liked to cheat on their vegetarian diet.\\nBased on the shape of their teeth and jaws, large plant-eating dinosaurs are generally thought to have been exclusively herbivorous. But for one group of dinosaurs, roughly 75-million-year-old poop tells another story. Their fossilized droppings, or coprolites, contained tiny fragments of mollusk and other crustacean shells along with an abundance of rotten wood, researchers report September 21 in Scientific Reports. Eating the crustaceans as well as the wood might have given the dinosaurs an extra dose of nutrients during breeding season to help form eggs and nourish the embryos.\\n“Living herd animals do occasionally turn carnivore to fulfill a particular nutritional need,” says vertebrate paleontologist Paul Barrett of the Natural History Museum in London. “Sheep and cows are known to eat carcasses or bone when they have a deficiency in a mineral such as phosphorus or calcium, or if they’re pregnant or ill.” But the discovery that some plant-eating dinos also ate crustaceans is the first example of this behavior in an extinct herbivore, says Barrett, who was not involved in the new study.\\nTen years ago, paleoecologist Karen Chin of the University of Colorado Boulder described finding large pieces of rotted wood in dino dung. The coprolites were within a layer of rock in Montana, known as the Two Medicine Formation, dating to between 80 million and 74 million years ago. That layer also contained numerous fossils of Maiasaura, a type of large, herbivorous duck-billed dinosaur, or hadrosaur (SN: 8/9/14, p. 20).\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0.231153\n",
      "﻿Barn owl ears age well. Unlike other animals, the birds don’t suffer from hearing loss as a hallmark of aging, a new study suggests.\\nBeyond people, age-related hearing loss has been documented in mice, gerbils and chinchillas. Those deficits are linked to deterioration of the tiny hair cells that line the sensory layer of the eardrum. But some evidence hints that birds may not suffer from dips in hearing.\\nBianca Krumm and her colleagues at the University of Oldenburg in Germany tested the ear sensitivity of seven barn owls (Tyto alba) grouped by age. There weren’t significant differences in what 2-year-old owls could hear versus those age 13 or older, suggesting the birds’ ears remain intact despite age, the researchers conclude September 20 in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\\nWhile the exact mechanism for this apparent ear agelessness remains elusive, the researchers suspect that the birds must continuously regenerate sensory ear tissue — a process that wanes with age in other species.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0.231132\n",
      "﻿The largest marsupial to ever walk the Earth just got another accolade: It’s also the only marsupial known to migrate seasonally.\\nDiprotodon optatum was a massive wombat-like herbivore that lived in what’s now Australia and New Guinea during the Pleistocene, until about 40,000 years ago. Now, an analysis of one animal’s teeth suggests that it undertook long, seasonal migrations like those made by zebras and wildebeests in Africa.  \\nAnimals pick up the chemical element strontium through their diet, and it leaves a record in their teeth. The ratio of different strontium isotopes varies from place to place, so it can provide clues about where an animal lived. Strontium isotope ratios in an incisor from one D. optatum revealed a repeating pattern. That suggests the animal migrated seasonally — it moved around, but generally hit up the same rest stops each year, researchers report September 27 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\\nIt’s the first evidence to show a marsupial — living or extinct — migrating in this way, says study coauthor Gilbert Price, a paleoecologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.  It’s not clear exactly why this mega-marsupial might have migrated, but an analysis of the carbon isotopes in its teeth suggests it ate a fairly limited diet. So it might have migrated to follow food sources that popped up seasonally in different places, the authors suggest.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0.207247\n",

      "﻿An imaging technique that lets scientists capture 3-D views of proteins, viruses and other molecules at the atomic scale has won its developers the 2017 Nobel Prize in chemistry.\\nJacques Dubochet of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, Joachim Frank of Columbia University and Richard Henderson of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge will share the prize, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October 4.\\nCalled cryo-electron microscopy, the imaging technique freezes biological molecules in place and reveals their inner workings.\\nApplying electron microscopy to biology was a challenge because the technique is done in a vacuum, which can dry out and distort the shape of proteins and other biological molecules. Historically, this kind of microscopy was used to look at nonliving things.\\nAfter working on the problem for years, in 1990, Henderson captured the first 3-D image of a protein using an electron microscope. Frank developed a way to combine blurry 2-D images into a sharp 3-D picture, which made the technique more useful for looking at complex proteins. And Dubochet discovered how to freeze water around molecules so rapidly that it couldn’t create crystals that would disrupt the electron beams and distort the images.\\nSince then, the technique has been honed even further, improving its resolution. It’s been used to capture up-close pictures of the Zika virus, to examine the inner workings of circadian clocks and more.\\n\\n

      "﻿An imaging technique that freezes tiny biological objects such as proteins and viruses in place so that scientists can peer into their structures at the scale of atoms has won its developers the 2017 Nobel Prize in chemistry.\\nJacques Dubochet of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, Joachim Frank of Columbia University and Richard Henderson of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, won for their contributions to the development of the technique, called cryo-electron microscopy, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October 4. The three will share the 9-million-Swedish-kronor (about $1.1 million) prize.\\n“Now that we can see the intricate details of every drop of our body fluids, we can understand how they are built and how they act and how they work together,” Sara Snogerup Linse, chair of the 2017 chemistry Nobel committee, said at a news conference. “We are facing a revolution in biochemistry…. Soon, there are no more secrets.”\\nAndrew Murray, a systems biologist at Harvard University, applauded the choice. “These are people whose work lies at the basis of an incredibly important technique.” The award, he says, “recognizes people who’ve done science for science’s sake…. The ultimate goal is to see molecules up close and personal.”  \\nTo map the minute landscape of molecules, at scales as tiny as just tenths of a nanometer, and help decipher their functions, structural biologists have long relied on two tools: nuclear magnetic resonance, or NMR, spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. But both techniques have limitations. X-ray crystallography creates a 3-D picture of a molecule’s structure by bouncing X-rays off of a crystallized version of a molecule and reconstructing the molecule’s structure based on those diffraction patterns. “But a lot of proteins cannot be crystallized, so their structures are inaccessible to the prying mind of the biochemist,” Murray says. NMR, meanwhile, allows researchers to study biological molecules in a solution, such as water — but its use has generally been limited to relatively small proteins.\\nEnter cryo-electron microscopy, or cryo-EM. In the 1970s, Henderson first attempted to use regular electron microscopy to study a protein embedded in the membrane of a cell. He was unable to crystallize the protein and didn’t want to remove it from the membrane and thereby risk altering its structure.\\nElectron microscopy wasn’t ideal for studying biological molecules. This technique works by shining a beam of electrons through a sample and observing how the electrons are deflected by the material they’ve passed through. The pattern of those deflections sketches out the material’s atomic structure. But the powerful electron beams can incinerate the material as they pass through it, weakening the beam and producing fuzzy images. Another drawback: The material must be in a vacuum in the microscope and that causes water within biological molecules to evaporate, distorting their shapes.\\nTo get around these problems, in 1975 Henderson placed bacterial proteins, still within their membrane so that they retained their structures, within the microscope and covered the membrane with a glucose solution to keep it from drying out. He used a weaker electron beam to minimize the damage. Because the beam was weaker, the images were fuzzier than they would have been with a beam at full strength. But since the proteins in his sample happened to be oriented in the same direction, Henderson was able to compile the fuzzy images from each protein in the membrane to generate one sharper image. He then turned the membrane this way and that, capturing the proteins in different orientations and compiling those 2-D images to see the protein’s structure in three dimensions. The image, while an improvement over past efforts, wasn’t quite at the atomic scale yet — that required other advances.\\nOne such advance came from Frank, who was tackling the issue of orientation. Unlike Henderson’s proteins, most proteins in a sample wouldn’t all be oriented in the same direction and conveniently ready to compile. Frank’s solution, published in 1981, was to create a computer algorithm to scan the images to look for any proteins oriented in the same direction and group them together. Like Henderson’s compiled image, each group in Frank’s image would be compiled to create a sharper picture.  \\nMeanwhile, Dubochet was considering the problem of dehydration. Henderson’s glucose solution wouldn’t work for most biomolecules. Freezing samples also wouldn’t work, because ice crystals distort molecules’ shapes. But, he realized, if the water were to cool extremely rapidly to ‒196 ° Celsius — in ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen — it would solidify without forming ice crystals, instead becoming vitreous, or glassy. In 1984, he showed that viruses, when covered with a fine layer of vitrified water, could be safely studied in the electron microscope.\\nThat cryo-EM technique dovetailed with Henderson’s efforts, and in 1990, Henderson produced the first cryo-EM image of a protein at the atomic scale. The following year, Frank prepared ribosomes, cellular structures that help make proteins, using the cryo-EM method. But for some time, the resolution of the images remained unsatisfying enough that many researchers called it “blobology.”\\nOver time, however, other researchers have built on those innovations to improve that resolution with better optics, detectors and computational techniques. In 2015, structural biologist Sriram Subramaniam of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., reported improving the resolutionof cryo-EM images to an ultrafine 0.22-nanometer scale — finally rivaling the impressive resolution of images produced by X-ray crystallography, the current gold standard.\\n“Now, we need to apply this to look at larger complexes to understand how these different molecular machines work,” Subramaniam says.\\nOver the last few years, cryo-EM has begun to demonstrate its potential, including revealing the structure of larger and larger objects, such as viruses. In 2016, cryo-EM was used to map the structure of the Zika virus (SN: 4/30/16, p. 10), helping to identify possible regions to target with a vaccine or antiviral compounds.\\n“Cryo-EM has revolutionized structural biology, particularly in the last three years, with the invention of new kinds of electron detectors for the microscope,” says Michael Rossmann, a physicist and microbiologist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., and a coauthor of the Zika mapping study. “We call it the ‘resolution revolution.’” Next up, he says: looking at an entire cell.\\nNotes Subramaniam: “This is just the beginning. There are exciting years ahead.”\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0.641025\n",
      "﻿Discoveries about the molecular ups and downs of fruit flies’ daily lives have won Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbashand Michael W. Young the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.\\nThese three Americans were honored October 2 by the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm for their work in discovering important gears in the circadian clocks of animals. The trio will equally split the 9 million Swedish kronor prize — each taking home the equivalent of $367,000.\\nThe researchers did their work in fruit flies. But “an awful lot of what was subsequently found out in the fruit flies turns out also to be true and of huge relevance to humans,” says John O’Neill, a circadian cell biologist at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England. Mammals, humans included, have circadian clocks that work with the same logic and many of the same gears found in fruit flies, say Jennifer Loros and Jay Dunlap, geneticists at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College.\\nCircadian clocks are networks of genes and proteins that govern daily rhythms and cycles such as sleep, the release of hormones, the rise and fall of body temperature and blood pressure, as well as other body processes. Circadian rhythms help organisms, including humans, anticipate and adapt to cyclic changes of light, dark and temperature caused by Earth’s rotation. When circadian rhythms are thrown out of whack, jet lag results. Shift workers and people with chronic sleep deprivation experience long-term jet lag that has been linked to serious health consequences including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, obesity and depression.\\nBefore the laureates did their work, other scientists had established that plants and animals have circadian rhythms. In 1971, Seymour Benzer and Ronald Konopka (both now deceased and ineligible for the Nobel Prize) found that fruit flies with mutations in a single gene called period had disrupted circadian rhythms, which caused the flies to move around at different times of day than normal.\\n“But then people got stuck,” says chronobiologist Erik Herzog of Washington University in St. Louis. “We couldn’t figure out what that gene was or how that gene worked.”\\nAt Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., Hall, a geneticist, teamed up with molecular biologist Rosbash to identify the period gene at the molecular level in 1984. Young of the Rockefeller University in New York City simultaneously deciphered the gene’s DNA makeup. “In the beginning, we didn’t even know the other group was working on it, until we all showed up at a conference together and discovered we were working on the same thing,” says Young. “We said, ‘Well, let’s forge ahead. Best of luck.’”  \\n\\n

      "﻿Discoveries about the clocklike ups and downs of daily life have won Jeffery C. Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W. Young the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.\\nCircadian rhythms are daily cycles of hormones, gene activity and other biological processes that govern sleep, body temperature and metabolism. When thrown out of whack, there can be serious health consequences, including increased risk of diabetes, heart and Alzheimer’s diseases.\\nHall and Rosbash discovered the first molecular gear of the circadian clockworks: A protein called Period increases and decreases in abundance on a regular cycle during the day. Young discovered that another protein called Timeless works with Period to drive the clock. Young also discovered other circadian clockworks.\\n\\n

      "﻿For the first time, astronomers have directly measured the distance to a spot clear across the galaxy. The established but challenging technique promises a new way to map the structure of the Milky Way.\\nThis technique, called parallax, has measured distances to stars since the 1830s. But because of galactic dust in the way, it has been difficult to use parallax on stars on the opposite side of the galaxy. Other ways to measure distance are saddled with assumptions and uncertainties.\\nAlberto Sanna of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany, and his colleagues used the Very Long Baseline Array of radio telescopes in New Mexico to track a star-forming region in the outer Scutum-Centaurus spiral arm, which is on the opposite side of the Milky Way from the local arm where the sun resides. The scientists report in the October 13 Science that the region is more than 66,500 light-years away.\\nThe team observed the distant spot from March 2014 to March 2015, and drew an imaginary triangle between it and two points in Earth’s orbit. They then used trigonometry to measure the distance.\\n“Our measurement is essentially the same as a surveyor uses to locate points on the Earth,” says study coauthor Mark Reid of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. “It requires no model or assumptions.”\\nApplying the same technique to other regions of the Milky Way will help astronomers figure out what our galaxy looks like from the outside and compare it to other spiral galaxies.\\n“We predict that, within the next 10 years, we will be able to answer the question: What does the Milky Way look like?” Sanna says.\\n\\n

Known as the spin Nernst effect, the newly detected phenomenonwas the only one in a cadre of related spin effects that hadn’t previously been spotted, researchers report online September 11 in Nature Materials.\\n“The last missing piece in the puzzle was spin Nernst and that's why we set out to search for this,” says study coauthor Sebastian Goennenwein, a physicist at the Technical University of Dresden in Germany.\\nThe effect and its brethren — with names like the spin Hall effect, the spin Seebeck effect and the spin Peltier effect — allow scientists to create flows of electron spins, or spin currents. Such research could lead to smaller and more efficient electronic gadgets that use electrons’ spins to store and transmit information instead of electric charge, a technique known as “spintronics.”\\nIn the spin Nernst effect, named after Nobel laureate chemist Walther Nernst, heating one end of a metal causes electrons to flow toward the other end, bouncing around inside the material as they go. Within certain materials, that bouncing has a preferred direction: Electrons with spins pointing up (as if twirling counterclockwise) go to the right and electrons with spins pointing down (as if twirling clockwise) go to the left, creating an overall spin current. Although the effect had been predicted, no one had yet observed it.\\nFinding evidence of the effect required disentangling it from other heat- and charge-related effects that occur in materials. To do so, the researchers coupled the platinum to a layer of a magnetic insulator, a material known as yttrium iron garnet. Then, they altered the direction of the insulator’s magnetization, which changed whether the spin current could flow through the insulator. That change slightly altered a voltage measured along the strip of platinum. The scientists measured how this voltage changed with the direction of the magnetization to isolate the fingerprints of the spin Nernst effect.\\n“The measurement was a tour de force; the measurement was ridiculously hard,” says physicist Joseph Heremans of Ohio State University in Columbus, who was not involved with the research. The effect could help scientists to better understand materials that may be useful for building spintronic devices, he says. “It’s really a new set of eyes on the physics of what’s going on inside these devices.”\\nA relative of the spin Nernst effect called the spin Hall effect is much studied for its potential use in spintronic devices. In the spin Hall effect, an electric field pushes electrons through a material, and the particles veer off to the left and right depending on their spin. The spin Nernst effect relies on the same basic physics, but uses heat instead of an electric field to get the particles moving.\\n“It's a beautiful experiment. It shows very nicely the spin Nernst effect,” says physicist Greg Fuchs of Cornell University. “It beautifully unifies our understanding of the interrelation between charge, heat and spin transport.”\\n\\n

      "﻿As far as last meals go, squid isn’t a bad choice. Cephalopod remains appear to dominate the stomach contents of a newly analyzed ichthyosaur fossil from nearly 200 million years ago.\\nThe ancient marine reptiles once roamed Jurassic seas and commonly pop up in England’s fossil-rich coast near Lyme Regis. But a lot of ichthyosaur museum specimens lack records of where they came from, making their age difficult to place.\\nDean Lomax of the University of Manchester and his colleagues reexamined one such fossil. Based on its skull, they identified the creature as a newborn Ichthyosaurus communis. Microfossils of shrimp and amoeba species around the ichthyosaur put the specimen at 199 million to 196 million years old, the researchers estimate.\\nTiny hook structures stand out in the newborn’s ribs — most likely the remnants of prehistoric black squid arms. Another baby ichthyosaur fossil that lived more recently had a stomach full of fish scales. So the new find suggests a shift in the menu for young ichthyosaurs at some point in their evolutionary history, the researchers write October 3 in Historical Biology.\\n\\n

      "﻿Two ultradense cores of dead stars have produced a long-awaited cosmic collision, showering scientists with riches.\\nThe event was the first direct sighting of a smashup of neutron stars, which are formed when aging stars explode and leave behind a neutron-rich remnant. In the wake of the collision, the churning residue forged gold, silver, platinum and a smattering of other heavy elements such as uranium, researchers reported October 16 at a news conference in Washington, D.C. Such elements’ birthplaces were previously unknown, but their origins were revealed by the cataclysm’s afterglow.\\n“It really is the last missing piece” of the periodic table, says Anna Frebel, an astronomer at MIT who was not involved in the research. “This is heaven for anyone working in the field.” After the collision, about 10 times the Earth’s mass in gold was spewed out into space, some scientists calculated.\\nUsing data gathered by about 70 different observatories, astronomers characterized the event in exquisite detail, releasing a slew of papers describing the results. A tremor of gravitational waves, spotted by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, LIGO, on August 17, provided the first sign of the cataclysm.\\n“Already it is transforming our understanding of the universe, with a fresh narrative of the physics of stars in their death throes,” said France Córdova, director of the National Science Foundation, which funds LIGO.\\nA sequence of various types of electromagnetic radiation followed that gravitational trill, like musical instruments taking turns in a symphony. A burst of gamma rays segued into a glow of visible and infrared light, first spotted about 12 hours after the smashup. More than a week later, as those wavelengths faded away, X-rays crescendoed, followed by radio waves.\\nCombining gravitational waves with light from a neutron star merger is a long-held dream of astrophysicists. “The picture that you can put together by having all of those sources is synergistic,” says LIGO spokesperson David Shoemaker of MIT. “You can make inferences that otherwise would be impossible.\"\\nThat detailed picture revealed the inner workings of neutron star collisions and the source of brief blasts of high-energy light called short gamma-ray bursts. Researchers also calculated how fast the universe is expanding and tested the properties of the odd material within neutron stars.\\nFor astrophysicists, “this event is the Rosetta stone,” says LIGO member Richard O’Shaughnessy of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York.\\nLIGO’s two detectors, located in the United States, registered an unmistakable sign of the upheaval: A shimmying of space itself that continued for about 100 seconds before cutting off. It was the strongest and longest series of spacetime ripples LIGO had ever seen. At that point, scientists knew they had something big, says LIGO member Vicky Kalogera of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. “The e-mails that were circulated said, ‘Oh my God, this is it.’”\\nThat vibration was an indication of a cosmic crash: Whirling round each other as if on an ill-fated merry-go-round, two orbiting neutron stars spiraled closer and closer, until they converged. The neutron stars, whose masses were  between 1.17 and 1.60 times that of the sun, probably collapsed into a black hole, although LIGO scientists were unable to determine the stars' fate for certain. LIGO has previously spotted mergers of swirling black holes with masses tens of times that of the sun (SN Online: 9/27/17); the smaller masses of the orbiting duo pointed the finger at neutron stars. And because black holes aren’t expected to emit light, the fireworks show that followed solidified the case for neutron stars.\\nLIGO’s sister experiment in Italy, Advanced Virgo, saw only a faint signal. That relatively weak detection helped narrow down where the convulsion occurred to “a part of the sky that was a blind spot of Virgo,” Kalogera says. That constrained the site to within a region of about 30 square degrees in the southern sky.\\nJust 1.7 seconds after the gravitational wave signal, NASA’s Fermi space telescope spotted a glimmer of gamma rays in the same neighborhood of the sky. Meanwhile, other telescopes swung into action, picking up a glow where none had been before. “We saw what looked like a new star,” says astronomer Edo Berger of Harvard University, who led a team that spotted the light with the DECam on the Blanco telescope in Chile. Berger’s was one of several teams that observed the blast’s light. That detection pinpointed the galaxy NGC 4993, 130 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Hydra, as the collision site. “There was this moment of disbelief: Wow, we actually did it. We found it,” Berger says.\\nThat afterglow also revealed an amazing story of stellar alchemy: With the stars’ death came the birth of elements. As the collision spurted neutron-rich material into space, a bevy of heavy elements formed, through a chain of reactions called the r-process (SN: 5/14/16, p. 9). In this process, which requires an environment crammed with neutrons, atomic nuclei rapidly gobble up neutrons and decay radioactively, thereby transforming into new elements, before resuming their neutron gorgefest. The r-process is thought to produce about half of the elements heavier than iron.\\nScientists detected the characteristic glow of this process, called a kilonova, in follow-up observations. “Until this event, we had never directly seen anywhere in nature these heavy elements being forged. Now we have,” says Brian Metzger, a theoretical astrophysicist at Columbia University. “It is a feeling like you’ve discovered some kind of secret of nature.”\\nPreviously, astrophysicists disagreed about where the r-process occurs: Two top candidates were exploding stars called supernovas (SN: 2/18/17, p. 24) and neutron star mergers. Although scientists can’t yet say whether all r-process elements are produced in neutron star mergers, the amount such collisions should produce appears large enough to explain the abundances found in the universe.\\nAdditional riches were revealed by gamma rays. Scientists spotted a phenomenon called a short gamma-ray burst, a brief spurt of high-energy light, less than two seconds long. Such paroxysms are relatively common, appearing in the sky about 50 times a year. But finding their source is “a long-standing problem in astrophysics,” says theoretical astrophysicist Rosalba Perna of Stony Brook University in New York. The detection clinched it: Short gamma-ray bursts come from neutron star tête-à-têtes.\\nBy studying how the neutron stars spiraled inward, astrophysicists also tested the “squishiness” of neutron star material for the first time. This extreme substance is so dense that a teaspoonful of it would have a mass of around a billion metric tons, and scientists don’t fully understand how it responds when squeezed, a property known as its “equation of state.” Measuring this property could give scientists a better understanding of the strange material. Although the results couldn’t pin down whether the neutron stars were squishy, some theories that predicted ultrasquishy neutron stars were ruled out.\\nThe neutron stars’ union also gave researchers the opportunity to gauge the universe’s expansion rate, by measuring the distance of the collision using gravitational waves and comparing that to how much the wavelength of light from the galaxy was stretched by the expansion. Scientists have previously measured this property, known as the Hubble constant, through other means. But those measurements are in disagreement, leaving scientists scrambling to explain the discrepancy (SN: 8/6/16, p. 10).\\nNow, scientists have “a totally different, independent measurement,” says LIGO collaboration member Daniel Holz of the University of Chicago. The new measurement indicates that distantly separated galaxies are spreading apart at about 70 kilometers per second for each megaparsec between them. It falls squarely between the two previous estimates: 67 and 73 km/s per megaparsec. Though this collision can’t yet resolve the debate, future mergers could help improve the measurement.\\n“These are all just unbelievable, major advances,” Holz says. “It’s really been this insane thrill.”\\nThe excitement has yet to die down. Take it from astronomer Ryan Foley of the University of California, Santa Cruz, whose team was the first to spot visible light from the merger: “This is certainly the biggest discovery of my career and probably will be the biggest discovery of my entire life.”\\n\\n    0.070865\n",
      "﻿When it comes to some oddball fish, looks can be deceiving.\\nPolypterus, today found only in Africa, and its close kin have generally been considered some of the most primitive ray-finned fishes alive, thanks in part to skeletal features that resemble those on some ancient fish. Now a new analysis of fish fossils of an early polypterid relative called Fukangichthys unearthed in China suggests that those features aren’t so old. The finding shakes up the evolutionary tree of ray-finned fishes, making the group as a whole about 20 million to 40 million years younger than thought, researchers propose online August 30 in Nature.\\nRay-finned fishes named for the spines, or rays, that support their fins — are the largest group of vertebrates, making up about half of all backboned animals. They include 30,000 living species, such as gars, bowfins and salmon. The group was thought to originate about 385 million years ago, in the Devonian Period. But the new research, using 3-D CT scans of the previously discovered fossils, shifts the fishes’ apparent origin to the start of the Carboniferous Period some 360 million years ago, says study coauthor Matt Friedman, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\\nOne of the largest extinction events in Earth’s history marks the boundary between the Devonian and Carboniferous. “We know that many groups of backboned animals were hard hit by the event,” Friedman says. But after the massive die-off, ray-finned fishes popped up and, according to previous fossil evidence, their diversity exploded. The new finding “brings the origin of the modern ray-finned fish group in line with this conspicuous pattern that we see in the fossil record,” Friedman says. It suggests these vertebrates didn’t survive the event. They came after, then flourished.\\n

      "﻿In a pitch-black rainforest with fluttering moths and crawling centipedes, Christina Warinner dug up her first skeleton. Well, technically it was a full skeleton plus two headless ones, all seated and draped in ornate jewelry. To deter looters, she excavated through the night while one teammate held up a light and another killed as many bugs as possible.\\nAs Warinner worked, unanswerable questions about the people whose skeletons she was excavating flew through her mind. “There’s only so much you can learn by looking with your own eyes at a skeleton,” she says. “I became increasingly interested in all the things that I could not see — all the stories that these skeletons had to tell that weren’t immediately accessible, but could be accessible through science.”\\nAt age 21, Warinner cut her teeth on that incredibly complex sacrificial burial left behind by the Maya in a Belize rainforest. Today, at age 37, the molecular anthropologist scrapes at not-so-pearly whites to investigate similar questions, splitting her time between the University of Oklahoma in Norman and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany.\\nIn 2014, she and colleagues reported a finding that generated enough buzz to renew interest in an archaeological resource many had written off decades ago: fossilized dental plaque, or calculus. Ancient DNA and proteins in the plaque belong to microbes that could spill the secrets of the humans they once inhabited — what the people ate, what ailed them, perhaps even what they did for a living.  \\nBacteria form plaque that mineralizes into calculus throughout a person’s life. “It’s the only part of your body that fossilizes while you’re still alive,” notes Warinner. “It’s also the last thing to decay.”\\nThough plaque is prolific in the archaeological record, most researchers viewed calculus as “the crap you scraped off your tooth in order to study it,” says Amanda Henry, an archaeologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands. With some exceptions, molecular biologists saw calculus as a shoddy source of ancient DNA.\\nBut a few researchers, including Henry, had been looking at calculus for remnants of foods as potential clues to ancient diets. Inspired by some of Henry’s images of starch grains preserved in calculus, Warinner wondered if the plaque might yield dead bacterial structures, perhaps even bacteria’s genetic blueprints.\\nHer timing couldn’t have been better. Warinner began her graduate studies at Harvard in 2004, just after the sequencing of the human genome was completed and by the time she left in 2010, efforts to survey the human microbiome were in full swing. As a postdoc at the University of Zurich, Warinner decided to attempt to extract DNA from the underappreciated dental grime preserved on the teeth of four medieval skeletons from Germany.\\nAt first, the results were dismal. But she kept at it. “Tina has a very interested, curious and driven personality,” Henry notes. Warinner turned to a new instrument that could measure DNA concentrations in skimpy samples, a Qubit fluorometer. A surprising error message appeared: DNA too high. Dental calculus, it turned out, was chock-full of genetic material. “While people were struggling to pull out human DNA from the skeleton itself, there’s 100 to 1,000 times more DNA in the calculus,” Warinner says. “It was sitting there in almost every skeletal collection untouched, unanalyzed.”\\nTo help her interpret the data, Warinner mustered an army of collaborators from fields ranging from immunology to metagenomics. She and her colleagues found a slew of proteins and DNA snippets from bacteria, viruses and fungi, including dozens of oral pathogens, as well as the full genetic blueprint of an ancient strain of Tannerella forsythia, which still infects people’s gums today. In 2014, Warinner’s team revealed a detailed map of a miniature microbial world on the decaying teeth of those German skeletons in Nature Genetics.\\nLater in 2014, her group found the first direct protein-based evidence of milk consumption in the plaque of Bronze Age skeletons from 3000 B.C. That same study linked milk proteins preserved in the calculus of other ancient human skeletons to specific animals — providing a peek into long-ago lifestyles.\\n“The fact that you can tell the difference between, say, goat milk and cow milk, that’s kind of mind-blowing,” says Laura Weyrich, a microbiologist at the University of Adelaide in Australia, who also studies calculus.\\nSince then, Warinner has found all sorts of odds and ends lurking on archaic chompers from poppy seeds to paint pigments. Warinner’s team is still looking at the origins of dairying and its microbial players, but she’s also branching out to the other end of the digestive spectrum. The researchers are looking at ancient DNA in paleofeces, which is exactly what it sounds like — desiccated or semifossilized poop. It doesn’t stay as fresh as plaque in the archaeological record. But she’s managed to find some sites with well-preserved samples. By examining the array of microbes that lived in the excrement and plaque of past humans and their relatives, Warinner hopes to characterize how our microbial communities have changed through time — and how they’ve changed us.\\nThe research has implications for understanding chronic, complex human diseases over time. Warinner’s ancient DNA work “opens up a window on past health,” says Clark Larsen, an anthropologist at Ohio State University.  \\nIt’s all part of what Warinner calls “the archaeology of the unseen.”\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.065559\n",

      "﻿Two ultradense cores of dead stars have produced a long-awaited cosmic collision, showering scientists with riches.\\nThe event was the first direct sighting of a smashup of neutron stars, which are formed when aging stars explode and leave behind a neutron-rich remnant. In the wake of the collision, the churning residue forged gold, silver, platinum and a smattering of other heavy elements such as uranium, researchers reported October 16 at a news conference in Washington, D.C. Such elements’ birthplaces were previously unknown, but their origins were revealed by the cataclysm’s afterglow.\\n“It really is the last missing piece” of the periodic table, says Anna Frebel, an astronomer at MIT who was not involved in the research. “This is heaven for anyone working in the field.” After the collision, about 10 times the Earth’s mass in gold was spewed out into space, some scientists calculated.\\nUsing data gathered by about 70 different observatories, astronomers characterized the event in exquisite detail, releasing a slew of papers describing the results. A tremor of gravitational waves, spotted by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, LIGO, on August 17, provided the first sign of the cataclysm.\\n“Already it is transforming our understanding of the universe, with a fresh narrative of the physics of stars in their death throes,” said France Córdova, director of the National Science Foundation, which funds LIGO.\\nA sequence of various types of electromagnetic radiation followed that gravitational trill, like musical instruments taking turns in a symphony. A burst of gamma rays segued into a glow of visible and infrared light, first spotted about 12 hours after the smashup. More than a week later, as those wavelengths faded away, X-rays crescendoed, followed by radio waves.\\nCombining gravitational waves with light from a neutron star merger is a long-held dream of astrophysicists. “The picture that you can put together by having all of those sources is synergistic,” says LIGO spokesperson David Shoemaker of MIT. “You can make inferences that otherwise would be impossible.\"\\nThat detailed picture revealed the inner workings of neutron star collisions and the source of brief blasts of high-energy light called short gamma-ray bursts. Researchers also calculated how fast the universe is expanding and tested the properties of the odd material within neutron stars.\\nFor astrophysicists, “this event is the Rosetta stone,” says LIGO member Richard O’Shaughnessy of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York.\\nLIGO’s two detectors, located in the United States, registered an unmistakable sign of the upheaval: A shimmying of space itself that continued for about 100 seconds before cutting off. It was the strongest and longest series of spacetime ripples LIGO had ever seen. At that point, scientists knew they had something big, says LIGO member Vicky Kalogera of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. “The e-mails that were circulated said, ‘Oh my God, this is it.’”\\nThat vibration was an indication of a cosmic crash: Whirling round each other as if on an ill-fated merry-go-round, two orbiting neutron stars spiraled closer and closer, until they converged. The neutron stars, whose masses were  between 1.17 and 1.60 times that of the sun, probably collapsed into a black hole, although LIGO scientists were unable to determine the stars' fate for certain. LIGO has previously spotted mergers of swirling black holes with masses tens of times that of the sun (SN Online: 9/27/17); the smaller masses of the orbiting duo pointed the finger at neutron stars. And because black holes aren’t expected to emit light, the fireworks show that followed solidified the case for neutron stars.\\nLIGO’s sister experiment in Italy, Advanced Virgo, saw only a faint signal. That relatively weak detection helped narrow down where the convulsion occurred to “a part of the sky that was a blind spot of Virgo,” Kalogera says. That constrained the site to within a region of about 30 square degrees in the southern sky.\\nJust 1.7 seconds after the gravitational wave signal, NASA’s Fermi space telescope spotted a glimmer of gamma rays in the same neighborhood of the sky. Meanwhile, other telescopes swung into action, picking up a glow where none had been before. “We saw what looked like a new star,” says astronomer Edo Berger of Harvard University, who led a team that spotted the light with the DECam on the Blanco telescope in Chile. Berger’s was one of several teams that observed the blast’s light. That detection pinpointed the galaxy NGC 4993, 130 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Hydra, as the collision site. “There was this moment of disbelief: Wow, we actually did it. We found it,” Berger says.\\nThat afterglow also revealed an amazing story of stellar alchemy: With the stars’ death came the birth of elements. As the collision spurted neutron-rich material into space, a bevy of heavy elements formed, through a chain of reactions called the r-process (SN: 5/14/16, p. 9). In this process, which requires an environment crammed with neutrons, atomic nuclei rapidly gobble up neutrons and decay radioactively, thereby transforming into new elements, before resuming their neutron gorgefest. The r-process is thought to produce about half of the elements heavier than iron.\\nScientists detected the characteristic glow of this process, called a kilonova, in follow-up observations. “Until this event, we had never directly seen anywhere in nature these heavy elements being forged. Now we have,” says Brian Metzger, a theoretical astrophysicist at Columbia University. “It is a feeling like you’ve discovered some kind of secret of nature.”\\nPreviously, astrophysicists disagreed about where the r-process occurs: Two top candidates were exploding stars called supernovas (SN: 2/18/17, p. 24) and neutron star mergers. Although scientists can’t yet say whether all r-process elements are produced in neutron star mergers, the amount such collisions should produce appears large enough to explain the abundances found in the universe.\\nAdditional riches were revealed by gamma rays. Scientists spotted a phenomenon called a short gamma-ray burst, a brief spurt of high-energy light, less than two seconds long. Such paroxysms are relatively common, appearing in the sky about 50 times a year. But finding their source is “a long-standing problem in astrophysics,” says theoretical astrophysicist Rosalba Perna of Stony Brook University in New York. The detection clinched it: Short gamma-ray bursts come from neutron star tête-à-têtes.\\nBy studying how the neutron stars spiraled inward, astrophysicists also tested the “squishiness” of neutron star material for the first time. This extreme substance is so dense that a teaspoonful of it would have a mass of around a billion metric tons, and scientists don’t fully understand how it responds when squeezed, a property known as its “equation of state.” Measuring this property could give scientists a better understanding of the strange material. Although the results couldn’t pin down whether the neutron stars were squishy, some theories that predicted ultrasquishy neutron stars were ruled out.\\nThe neutron stars’ union also gave researchers the opportunity to gauge the universe’s expansion rate, by measuring the distance of the collision using gravitational waves and comparing that to how much the wavelength of light from the galaxy was stretched by the expansion. Scientists have previously measured this property, known as the Hubble constant, through other means. But those measurements are in disagreement, leaving scientists scrambling to explain the discrepancy (SN: 8/6/16, p. 10).\\nNow, scientists have “a totally different, independent measurement,” says LIGO collaboration member Daniel Holz of the University of Chicago. The new measurement indicates that distantly separated galaxies are spreading apart at about 70 kilometers per second for each megaparsec between them. It falls squarely between the two previous estimates: 67 and 73 km/s per megaparsec. Though this collision can’t yet resolve the debate, future mergers could help improve the measurement.\\n“These are all just unbelievable, major advances,” Holz says. “It’s really been this insane thrill.”\\nThe excitement has yet to die down. Take it from astronomer Ryan Foley of the University of California, Santa Cruz, whose team was the first to spot visible light from the merger: “This is certainly the biggest discovery of my career and probably will be the biggest discovery of my entire life.”\\n\\n

      "﻿The gravitational wave paparazzi have tracked down the cosmic neighborhood of two merging black holes. Scientists pinpointed the region in the sky where the two black holes violently melded and kicked up swirls of the spacetime ripples, locating their stomping grounds more precisely than ever before.\\nResearchers from LIGO — the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory — and its sister experiment, Advanced Virgo, spotted the ripples on August 14. The team announced the finding September 27 at a news conference at a meeting of the G7 science ministers in Turin, Italy, and in a paper accepted in Physical Review Letters.\\nIt’s the first gravitational wave sighting to be made with three detectors: LIGO’s two detectors (in Livingston, La., and Hanford, Wash.) and Virgo’s detector near Pisa, Italy. “The three-detector network really opens up a new potential and we are going to make the most of that potential in the future,” said Virgo scientist Frédérique Marion, of the Laboratoire d’Annecy de Physique des Particules in France.\\nThe trio of detectors allowed scientists to trace the source of the waves to a spot in the sky with an area of just 60 square degrees. Viewed in the night sky, the size of that region is about 300 times that of the full moon as seen from Earth. The ripples journeyed to Earth from about 1.8 billion light-years away, in a region near the constellation Eridanus in the southern sky.\\nLIGO has previously detected three black hole crashes with its two detectors; in each case, scientists carved out a swath of sky from which the waves could have come, but could not discern a more specific cosmic birthplace. The newfound black holes were located within a region about a tenth the size of those associated with previous detections.\\nBecause gravitational waves take time to complete the cross-planet jaunt from one detector to another, the three detectors spotted the signal at slightly different times. LIGO’s Livingston detector saw the waves first, followed by the LIGO Hanford detector 8 milliseconds later, and by the Virgo detector another 6 milliseconds after that. By analyzing these delays and the patterns of the ripples each detector saw, scientists were able to deduce what direction they came from.\\nScientists estimated the colliding black holes’ masses at about 31 and 25 times the sun’s mass. During the collision, approximately three solar masses were converted into energy and radiated as gravitational waves, leaving behind a 53-solar-mass black hole.\\nThe LIGO and Virgo detectors teamed up August 1 (SN Online: 8/1/17), when Virgo began officially taking data for the first time in its current, upgraded form. Previous incarnations of both LIGO and Virgo ran for years without detecting a whiff of spacetime wiggles. Now the detectors are finally sensitive enough to pick up the tiny tremors. The improved trio operated in tandem until August 25, when the detectors shut down for further improvements.\\nVirgo also allowed scientists to better test Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Because Virgo’s detector isn’t oriented parallel to the LIGO detectors, scientists could study the polarization of the waves  — the specific pattern by which they stretch and squeeze spacetime — for the first time. “In the long run that’s a really big deal,” says physicist Clifford Will of the University of Florida in Gainesville, who was not involved with the detection. If unexpected kinds of stretching or squeezing were found, “it would kill general relativity, just like that. That would be the end.” But Einstein’s theory held its ground.\\nScouting out the locales where black hole pairs live allows astronomers to look for light produced in the collision. Although most scientists expect that no light will be emitted in black hole dust-ups, some theories suggest otherwise. After the ripples were detected, telescopes scoured the spot, but observations came up empty.\\nOther kinds of collisions, however — between two remnants of stars called neutron stars — could produce light. Therefore, the new detection “is good preparation for what's to come,”  says physicist Emanuele Berti of the University of Mississippi in Oxford, who was not involved with the detection. Spotting light from a neutron star pileup could help scientists learn more about the extremely dense material that makes up neutron stars. In August, rumors began flying that scientists had detected such an event (SN Online: 8/25/17). If the rumor is true, Berti says, with two detections in one month, “they’ve made giant strides.”\\n\\n

      "﻿To choose her research goals, Jennifer Dionne envisions conversations with hypothetical grandchildren, 50 years down the line. What would she want to tell them she had accomplished? Then, to chart a path to that future, “I work backward to figure out what are the milestones en route,” she says.\\nThat long-term vision has led the 35-year-old materials scientist on a quest to wrangle light and convince it to do her bidding in interactions with nanoparticles and various materials. Already, Dionne has created new nanomaterials that steer light in ways that are impossible with natural substances. Her new projects could eventually lead to light-based technologies used to improve drugs or to create new tests to find cancerous cells. There are even applications for renewable energy, for example, designing materials that help solar cells absorb more light.\\nBut the route to a scientific vision may not always be clear, so Dionne makes time for diversions. “A lot of the really amazing discoveries that we enjoy today came from just playing in the lab,” she says. Dionne encourages her team to let creativity be a guide, melding a serious sense of purpose with play.\\n“She’s a very curious person, so she’s always learning new things,” says Paul Alivisatos, the vice chancellor for research at the University of California, Berkeley, who mentored Dionne when she was a postdoc there. Plus, “she’s an extremely deep and rigorous thinker.”\\nDionne, now at Stanford University, studies nanophotonics, the way that light interacts with matter on very small scales. Her interest in light and materials began in childhood, she recalls, when she was fascinated by the blue morpho butterfly.\\nThe insect’s wings sport an azure hue that comes not from pigments, like most colors found in living things, but from tiny nanostructures on the wings’ surface (SN: 6/7/08, p. 26). When light reflects off the structures, blue wavelengths are amplified, while wavelengths corresponding to other colors are canceled out.\\nThat early interest in tricks of light led Dionne to begin wielding it as a tool during graduate school at Caltech and then her postdoc at UC Berkeley.  Then and now, says Alivisatos, “she has consistently done very beautiful work.”\\nAt Caltech, Dionne and colleagues created a bizarre optical material in which light bends backward. As light passes from one material to another — say, from air to water — the rays are deflected due to a property called the index of refraction. (That’s why a straw in a drinking glass appears to be broken at the water’s surface.) In natural materials, light always bends in the same direction. But that rule gets flipped around in oddball nanomaterials with a negative index of refraction.\\nDionne’s material, reported in Science in 2007, was the first that worked with visible light (SN: 3/24/07, p. 180). Because they can steer light around objects to hide the objects from view, such materials could be used to create rudimentary versions of invisibility cloaks — though so far all attempts are a far cry from Harry Potter’s version. Dionne is now working on a “squid skin” with an adjustable refractive index, which would mimic the shifting camouflage patterns of the stealthy cephalopod.\\nAnother focal point of Dionne’s research is harnessing light to separate mixtures of mirror-image molecules. Right- and left-handed versions of these molecules are perfect reflections of each other, like a person’s right and left hands. The two types are so similar that scientists struggle to separate them, which can cause problems for drugmakers. In drugs, these molecules can be two-faced; one might relieve pain, while the other causes unwanted side effects.\\nTo separate molecules and their mirror images, Dionne is developing techniques that use circularly polarized light, in which the light’s wiggling electromagnetic waves rotate over time. Such light can interact differently with right- and left-handed molecules, for example, breaking apart one version while leaving the other unscathed.\\nNormally, the light’s effect is very weak. But in a theoretical study published in ACS Photonics last December, Dionne and colleagues showed that adding nanoparticles to the mix could enhance the process. These tiny particles behave like antennas that concentrate the light onto nearby molecules, helping break them apart. Dionne is now working to implement the technique.\\nShe and her colleagues have also created nanoparticles that, when illuminated with infrared light, emit visible light. The color of that light changes depending on how tightly the nanoparticle is squeezed, the team reported in Nano Letters in June. In keeping with her penchant for creative exploration in the lab, Dionne and colleagues fed these nanoparticles to roundworms, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, to study the forces exerted as a transparent worm squeezed a meal through its digestive tract.\\n“You can see the nanoparticles change colors throughout,” Dionne says. She plans to use the technique to reveal more sinister squeezing. Cancer cells exert stronger mechanical forces on their environment than healthy cells, so such nanoparticles could one day be used to test for cancer, she says. Dionne is now cooking up other creative ways to use these nanoparticles. In collaboration with other researchers, she hopes to marshal her color-changing nanoparticles to understand how jellyfish move and how plants take a drink.\\nDionne’s work exploits light to reveal hidden forces — and as a force for good. “She’s done amazing work,” says materials scientist Prineha Narang of Harvard University. Narang was a graduate student at Caltech after Dionne left, and had heard chatter about Dionne before meeting her in person. “The legend of Jen Dionne was definitely all over,” Narang says. So Dionne has made a start at establishing her scientific legacy — even before that chat with her future grandchildren.\\n\\n

      "﻿For the first time, astronomers have directly measured the distance to a spot clear across the galaxy. The established but challenging technique promises a new way to map the structure of the Milky Way.\\nThis technique, called parallax, has measured distances to stars since the 1830s. But because of galactic dust in the way, it has been difficult to use parallax on stars on the opposite side of the galaxy. Other ways to measure distance are saddled with assumptions and uncertainties.\\nAlberto Sanna of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany, and his colleagues used the Very Long Baseline Array of radio telescopes in New Mexico to track a star-forming region in the outer Scutum-Centaurus spiral arm, which is on the opposite side of the Milky Way from the local arm where the sun resides. The scientists report in the October 13 Science that the region is more than 66,500 light-years away.\\nThe team observed the distant spot from March 2014 to March 2015, and drew an imaginary triangle between it and two points in Earth’s orbit. They then used trigonometry to measure the distance.\\n“Our measurement is essentially the same as a surveyor uses to locate points on the Earth,” says study coauthor Mark Reid of the

      "﻿Evidence is piling up that much of the universe’s missing matter is lurking along the strands of a vast cosmic web.\\nA pair of papers report some of the best signs yet of hot gas in the spaces between galaxy clusters, possibly enough to represent the half of all ordinary matter previously unaccounted for. Previous studies have hinted at this missing matter, but a new search technique is helping to fill in the gaps in the cosmic census where other efforts fell short. The papers were published online at arXiv.org on September 15 and September 29.\\nTwo independent teams stacked images of hundreds of thousands of galaxies on top of one another to reveal diffuse filaments of gas connecting pairs of galaxies across millions of light-years. Measuring how the gas distorted the background light of the universe let the researchers determine the mass of ordinary matter, or baryons, that it held — the protons and neutrons that make up atoms.\\n“It’s a very important problem,” says Dominique Eckert of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, who has searched for the missing matter via X-rays emitted by individual strands. “If you want to understand how galaxies form and how everything forms within a galaxy, you have to understand the evolution of the baryon content.”  That starts with knowing where it is.\\nAbout 85 percent of the matter in the universe is mysterious, invisible stuff called dark matter, which physicists have yet to find (SN Online: 9/6/17). Weirdly, about half of the ordinary matter is also unaccounted for. When astronomers look around at the galaxies in the nearest few billion light-years, they find only about half the baryons that should have been produced in the Big Bang.\\nThe rest is probably hiding in long filaments of gas that connect galaxy clusters in a vast cosmic web (SN: 3/8/14, p. 8). Previous attempts to find the baryons focused on X-rays emitted by gas in the filaments (SN Online: 8/4/15) or on the light of distant quasars filtering through these cobwebby strands (SN: 5/13/00, p. 310). But those efforts were either inconclusive, or were sensitive to such a narrow range of gas temperatures that they missed much of the matter.\\nNow there might be a way to find the rest. Two groups — cosmologist Hideki Tanimura, who did the work while at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and his colleagues, and Anna de Graaff of the University of Edinburgh and her colleagues — have sought the missing matter in a new way. Both teams found a way to look through the gas all the way back to the oldest light in the universe.\\n“Filamentary gas is very difficult to detect, but now we have a technique to detect it,” says Tanimura, now with the Institute of Space Astrophysics in Orsay, France.\\nThat ancient light, called the cosmic microwave background, was emitted 380,000 years after the Big Bang. When this light passes though clouds of electrons in space — such as those found in filaments of hot gas — it gets deflected and distorted in a specific way. The Planck satellite released an all-sky map of these distortions in 2015 (SN: 3/21/15, p. 7).\\nTanimura and de Graaff separately figured that there would be more distortion along the filaments than in empty space. To locate the filaments, both teams chose pairs of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey catalog that were at least 20 million light-years apart. De Graaff’s team chose roughly a million pairs, and Tanimura’s team chose 262,864 pairs. Both teams assumed that the galaxies were not part of the same cluster, but that they should be connected by a filament.\\nThe filaments were still too faint to see individually, so the teams used software to layer all the images and subtracted out distortion from electrons in the galaxies to see what was left. Both saw a residual distortion in the cosmic microwave background, which they attribute to the filaments.\\nNext, de Graaff’s team calculated that those filaments account for 30 percent of the total baryon content of the universe. That’s surely an underestimate, since they didn’t examine every filament in the universe, the team writes — the rest of the missing matter is probably there too.\\n“Both groups here took the obvious first step,” says Michael Shull of the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the new studies. “I think they’re on the right track.” But he worries that the gas they see might have been ejected from galaxies at high speeds, and so not actually the missing matter at all.\\nEckert also worries that the gas may belong more to the galaxies than to their intergalactic tethers. Future observations of the composition of the gas, as well as more sensitive X-ray observations, could help solve that part of the puzzle.\\n\\n

      "﻿Ninad Kothari’s workplace looks like something out of a sci-fi film. The graduate student at Johns Hopkins University works in a darkened, red-lit room, where he trains bats to fly through obstacle courses. Shielding within the walls keeps radio and other human-made signals from interfering with transmissions from the tiny electrical signals he’s recording from the bats’ brains as the animals bob and weave. Layers of foam further insulate the cavelike lab against sound waves. An array of cameras and microphones complete the futuristic scene.\\nThe high-tech setup has its homemade touches, too: In one obstacle course, bats dodge dangling Quaker oatmeal cylinders.\\nKothari is part of a small cadre of neuroscientists who are getting the best sense yet of how bat brains work at a cellular level, thanks to modern technologies. Eavesdropping tools, which rely on tiny probes that track the activities of individual nerve cells, or neurons, are now miniaturized enough to outfit bats with head-mounted, wireless sensors. As the animals fly freely around the lab, the researchers can listen in on neurons. \\nBy allowing the bats to behave naturally, unencumbered by bulky equipment, scientists will discover exciting new facets of how bat brains work, says neuroscientist Nachum Ulanovsky of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, who invented the new wireless sensors with colleagues. He and others, studying several different species of bats, are investigating how the flying mammals perceive their environment and navigate through it.\\nThe go-to lab animals for studying how the mammalian brain maps and navigates its surroundings are mice and rats. But bat researchers say their animal of choice offers distinct advantages. For one, rodent navigation studies are mostly limited to fairly basic environments in the lab, such as mazes. Those setups are “too simple to tell much about how the system operates in complex environments in the real world,” says Edvard Moser of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. Moser shared a 2014 Nobel Prize for discovering place cells in the rodent brain (SN Online: 10/6/14). Place cells help the animal identify its location in a mental map of the environment.\\nSince bats fly, scientists can more easily investigate how bat brains deal with space in three dimensions. Researchers are already reporting on new types of neurons not yet observed in rodents or other animals. Moser expects that rodent and human brains may map and navigate spaces in a manner similar to bats; scientists have already seen “striking” parallels between rat and bat brains, he says.\\nBats are also interesting to scientists because bat brains must switch between several kinds of input to make sense of the world. Like people, they use their ears and eyes (contrary to popular myth, no bat species is entirely blind, though some rely on vision more than others). On top of that, most bats also use echolocation to sense their surroundings. While flying, an echolocating bat produces calls that bounce off objects — such as trees to avoid or insects to chase — then return to the bat as echoes. With their supersensitive ears, and their finely tuned brains, bats use this information to determine where things are. The echolocation calls are typically beyond the range of human hearing, which is good because the calls are quite loud, about 100 decibels or so, says Khaleel A. Razak, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Riverside. He likens the volume to what a person would experience standing next to a pounding jackhammer.\\nBy tracking the routes bats fly, as well as their calls and the echoes they pick up, bat-brain aficionados are starting to match behavior with brain activity. In some of the most recent studies, scientists have begun to figure out how bats pinpoint the locations of the sounds of prey and map and navigate the greater world. The researchers may have a thing or two to teach sonar engineers. \\nGoing natural\\nTo understand bats’ brain activity at the level of individual neurons, researchers implant tiny wires. The aim is to read when individual neurons “fire,” that is, when one brain cell generates an electrical signal to send along to other cells in the brain or body. Exactly what these neurons are communicating remains hazy, but they might, for example, tell another part of the brain that there’s a sound coming in from the right or left.\\nThe hippocampus is where Ulanovsky focuses. This deep-brain structure, involved in learning and memory, is a place where bats make and store maps of their surroundings. Usually neuroscientists have to tether an animal to a bulky data recorder with wires, but Ulanovsky wants his bats to fly. He and colleagues designed a lightweight, miniature data logger small enough to mount atop a bat’s head. The recorder, which connects to the tiny implanted wires, wirelessly transmits its readings to Ulanovsky’s computer. “This allows us to get closer to the natural behavior,” he says.\\nUlanovsky asks how the firing patterns of neurons match up with the free-flying bats’ actions. In a handful of papers published since 2007, he and colleagues have identified key types of navigational neurons that scientists had also seen in rats, like place cells that fire when a bat is in a particular spot. Another type of cell, called grid cells, seems to work via an imaginary mental grid the brain lays over the real environment(SN Online: 8/5/13). These cells activate when a bat crosses the grid lines. Other neurons turn on when a bat’s head is at a particular angle. “We found them all in bats, just like in rodents,” Ulanovsky says. Those findings, though satisfying, told only half the story, he says: how a bat understands where it is at any given time. But what if the bat has a goal destination in mind, too? “We had an understanding of how point A is represented, but not point B,” he says. “It has been a big missing link.”\\nIn experiments reported in January in Science, Ulanovsky’s team identified hippocampal neurons responsible for keeping track of target destinations in Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), pointy-eared critters with doglike faces that use echolocation to find tasty fruits and nectar.\\nThe researchers trained the bats to fly around a room to a banana reward, which was sometimes hidden behind a curtain. In one experiment, the team placed wire probes in the hippocampus of three bats, eavesdropping on a total of 309 neurons in the vicinity of the electrodes. Of those, 58 fired when a bat was at certain angles to its goal and 49 fired when it was certain distances from its goal. Twenty-four of the neurons responded to both angle and distance. With input from those three types of neurons, the bat’s brain kept track of the location of the treat.\\n“It’s an exciting and important study,” says Hugo Spiers, a neuroscientist at University College London who studies navigation in people and rats. “How cells in the hippocampus might provide guidance signals has been very underinvestigated.” Spiers is now looking for similar goal-directed neurons in rats. People probably have neurons similar to those reported by Ulanovsky, Spiers adds.\\nActions and reactions\\nBefore starting his group at the Weizmann Institute, Ulanovsky learned about bats in the lab of Cynthia Moss, now Kothari’s adviser at Johns Hopkins. Moss focuses on an area on the surface of the brain, the midbrain superior colliculus. Like the hippocampus, the superior colliculus also maps a bat’s environment, but there’s a difference. The hippocampus makes a map of environmental features with respect to each other; no matter where the bat is, it keeps the same basic mental map. The superior colliculus generates a map of the world with the bat at the center, so the map changes as the animal moves.\\nThe superior colliculus links what an animal perceives with how it moves in response. In an eyesight-favoring animal like a human, that might mean turning the head or shifting gaze to get a better look at the sudden movement of an oncoming car or a zooming baseball. For bats, one role of the superior colliculus is to help the bat orient itself to sounds, such as the echoes of its own calls.\\nMost studies of animal sensory processing, including Moss’ past work, involve restrained animals. Studies might also use speakers emitting calls and echoes to create a sort of “virtual reality” for bats instead of using their natural calls and echoes, Moss notes. For more than a decade, she’s been working toward the experiments Kothari and postdoctoral researcher Melville Wohlgemuth recently performed in her high-tech bat room. Moss’ group is among the first to look at how neurons in the superior colliculus respond to the auditory world, in three dimensions, while an animal is freely moving.\\nMoss and her team study big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), which, in fact, are “not very big,” Moss says. They’re a bit smaller than the average hamster, though their wingspan is a foot long. In the wild, these bats nosh on beetles and other small insects. Measuring the precise distance to an insect meal, with both predator and prey aloft, is a crucial life skill.\\nAs the bats flew their oatmeal-container obstacle course, and another that required them to find a hole in a net, Kothari and Wohlgemuth recorded neuron activity, with sensors similar to Ulanovsky’s. But to match specific neurons with what the bats were doing and perceiving, the scientists needed to know what calls the animals produced, and what echoes the animals heard. That’s where the microphones around the room come in.\\nThe researchers took advantage of the fact that echolocation is a back and forth between a bat and its world. The bat can tune the direction and rate of its calls, depending on what it’s investigating. So the scientists, eavesdropping with ultrasonic microphones, can infer what the bats are homing in on, as if the animals are broadcasting, for example, “I’m focusing in on this yummy mealworm on my right.” Then, the researchers used computer software to predict what echoes would come back to the bat. (Putting mikes on the bats’ heads would be too heavy for the lightweight fliers, and probably not sensitive enough to pick up those echoes, anyway.)\\nMoss and colleagues predicted that certain neurons would respond to the angle an echo returned from, as well as to the time delay, which indicates the distance of the sound-reflecting object. Indeed, of 119 neurons the researchers managed to monitor from two big brown bats, 41 fired in response to an echo returning at particular angles and distances from the animal. Those neurons were helping the bats localize objects in three-dimensional space.\\nDuring their flights, the bats sometimes sent out sonar sound groups, rapid clusters of echolocation calls. Moss had hypothesized that these clusters help bats get better spatial resolution to really focus on the objects of greatest interest. That’s important, for instance, when navigating a dense forest or cluttered room. The new study, not yet published, supports the idea.\\nThe bats seem to use the clusters to narrow interest to objects a certain distance away, which the bats can measure by the time delay between their call and the returning echo. The farther away something is, the longer the delay. When the bats were just doing normal, nonclustered echolocation, a given neuron that fires for an eight-millisecond echo delay would also respond to a range of echo times — say, any time between four and 12 milliseconds, Moss explains. But when the bats emitted clustered calls, the same neuron would respond only to echoes coming in at a delay close to eight milliseconds. The bats were fine-tuning their brains so they could get a better, sharper impression of the most interesting objects, she says.\\nThe value of the study lies in the observations in untethered animals, says Shihab Shamma, a neuroscientist and engineer at the University of Maryland in College Park who studies sound processing in ferrets. “This one is more natural,” he says. “That’s really cool, to actually see what the processing is in the brain,” Shamma says.\\nBecause the circuitry of the superior colliculus is common across mammals, Kothari predicts that similar 3-D processing of space occurs in humans and other primates, too.\\nFrom all directions\\nThese latest findings with untethered bats broaden understanding of how animals navigate. But the researchers are well aware that each study focuses on only a small part of a larger process. For example, what happens after a navigation-related neuron in the superior colliculus or hippocampus fires? How does the brain turn neuron firing into a map of its world or a decision to move from here to there? “Very little is known,” Ulanovsky says.\\nRazak, at UC Riverside, has an idea about how the firing of certain neurons gets interpreted, though it’s only a hypothesis. He studies echolocation as well as direct listening for environmental sounds in a group of bat species called gleaning bats. They’re also called whispering bats because they emit quiet echolocation calls as they fly along, ears cocked for the rustles of insect prey on the ground.\\nSpecifically, Razak works with gleaners known as pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus), because of their white bellies, which Razak suspects might offer camouflage from the gaze of insects looking upward. Pallid bats are remarkably good at pinpointing the location of a sound, with an accuracy of 3 to 4 degrees, Razak says. Humans appear to be better at this task, able to tell the difference between sounds separated by just 1 to 2 degrees. But we have the advantage of several inches between our two ears, making it easier to triangulate the source of sound. “If you normalize to head size, the bat is a champion,” Razak says.\\nHe studies the auditory cortex, an outer part of the brain involved in hearing and interpreting sounds. In his previous research, Razak reported how certain cortex neurons, in anesthetized bats, respond to sounds coming in from different angles in a horizontal semicircle in front of the animal. In a 2015 report in the Journal of Neuroscience, he started to explain how bats determine the vertical angle to dinner.\\nThere are two overlapping maps in the cortex, one for horizontal and one for vertical angles. For the horizontal angle, one group of neurons fires when a sound comes in from directly in front of the bat’s nose. Other groups respond to sounds to the left or the right of the animal. The auditory cortex on the right side of the brain responds to sounds in what Razak refers to as the left “hemifield” — anywhere to the left side of the head. The more right-brain neurons are firing, the more directly to the left the sound is. The same thing happens on the left side of the bat’s brain, for sounds on the right.\\nA second map indicates the vertical angle. A few neurons fire for sounds that are coming in low, and more fire for sounds coming in from a higher elevation. To decode those signals, Razak hypothesizes, there could be some as-yet-undefined “comparer” that integrates the information from the two maps. If the comparer is getting mostly straight-ahead signals, it knows the sound is coming from dead in front of the bat’s nose. If it’s getting mostly right hemifield signals from the left side of the brain, it can deduce that the sound is coming from somewhere to the right side of the head, at a range of horizontal or vertical angles to the ear. If it’s hearing a lot of that input from the right side of the brain, then the sound is on the left.\\nThis theory is the first idea proposed for how the auditory cortex of any animal understands the location of an object at both horizontal and vertical angles, Razak says. He’s now designing experiments to test this idea and search for the comparer.\\nTaken together, these studies are beginning to paint a picture of what goes on in the brain as a bat perceives and moves through its environment. But there’s still plenty of uncertainty about the bat brain and how well it matches to what the human brain does. “These are still big questions: How do we make sounds and how does our brain control what we make? How do we develop the sense of localization?” says Razak. “The bats continue to offer some interesting insight.”\\nWhat’s already certain is that the flying creatures have earned the respect of the scientists working with them. After all, Moss notes, the big brown bat’s brain is the size of a lima bean, but still manages to process sounds in a way human sonar engineers envy.\\n\\n    0.186222\n",
      "﻿Bats, with their superb ability to echolocate, are inspiring advanced technologies — from better Navy sonar to gadgets that might deliver packages or help farmers manage crops. And engineers aren’t waiting for neuroscientists to work out every detail of how the bats’ brains manage the task.\\n“We think we have enough information to be useful to us, to develop a bio-inspired sensor,” says research engineer Jason Gaudette of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Newport Division in Rhode Island. Like bats, the Navy uses sonar to find and visualize objects in the deep. But current versions are far less elegant than the flying mammals’ system.\\nThe Navy’s sonar arrays can be huge, encompassing hundreds of “ears” that listen for sonar pings from atop a submarine’s dome or trailing behind it in a long tail. Bats, Gaudette notes, dodge obstacles and find mosquito-sized meals with just two ears. He and colleagues have developed a bat-inspired prototype device that they hope can perform more like bats do. Mounted on the nose of a half-meter-long, torpedo-shaped autonomous undersea robot, the sonar system has one sound transmitter and three receivers (Gaudette hopes to eventually get that number down to two or even one).\\nThe system uses algorithms inspired by research in bats to interpret returning sonar echoes for navigation. If it works, the system could help the Navy perform sonar imaging using less space and less money while offering sharper images, Gaudette says.\\nResearchers in Israel are hoping to help farmers with a bat-inspired kind of sonar. Neuroecologist Yossi Yovel of Tel Aviv University is creating computer algorithms describing how bats might interpret returning echoes to distinguish different plants.\\nYovel collaborates with Avital Bechar, a researcher at the Institute of Agricultural Engineering near Rishon LeZion, Israel, who wants to help farmers predict their crops’ yield, which can vary widely from year to year. The same acre of tomato plants, for example, could yield 30 or 120 tons of fruit, Bechar estimates. Such a wide range puts farmers at a disadvantage in negotiating a price for crops and forces the farmers to guess how much equipment and how many pickers they’ll need at harvest time.\\nBechar’s sonar system, which emits batlike sounds and records via microphones that mimic bat ears, can penetrate three rows of plants deep — farther than cameras could. Then it calculates the number of leaves and pounds of fruit per plant, based on Yovel’s algorithms. Bechar has mounted the scanner on a prototype robot and plans to affix it to a drone to count fruit in 15-meter-high date palms. The researchers also hope to add weed-detection capability. Bechar expects it to be “a game changer in agriculture, because it will reduce the unknowns.”\\nAt Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, engineer Rolf Mueller is learning tricks from the physical structures of bats’ noses and ears. Certain bat groups, such as horseshoe bats (one species Mueller works with is Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), send out their echolocation calls through their noses, like a snort. Complex, fleshy formations called nose-leaves change the outgoing sound as it comes out of the nose. And the bats’ ears have more than 20 muscles, which rapidly change shape as the bat listens for echoes, Mueller says. That flexibility gives the animals more information, he suspects: “It’s like seeing the world with a different perspective, at the same time, [from] one echo.”\\nHis group developed a prototype robot with mechanical “nose-leaves” and shape-shifting “ears,” and sent it zooming through forested areas on a zip line to record how the bot perceives trees and branches. Eventually, Mueller envisions an autonomous underwater bot or an airborne drone with a similar sonar setup. The drone could be useful for delivering packages in forested or otherwise complicated areas without crashing.\\n\\n

      "﻿By early next spring, astronomer David Kipping hopes to know if the object he’s spent his early career searching for is really there.\\nAn astronomer at Columbia University, Kipping is perhaps most known for a project sifting through data from the Kepler space telescope on more than a thousand planets orbiting distant stars. But he’s more interested in their moons. A moon could be a home to alien life even if its planet is inhospitable (SN: 2/9/13, p. 5). A moon could also make its host planet more likely to harbor life. Some models suggest that the presence of our moon might have helped make Earth a nice place to live. The same could be true for other moon-planet partnerships.\\nSo Kipping’s search, dubbed the Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler, gets at the fundamental nature of our place in the universe: Are we alone?\\nIn late October, Kipping and colleagues will use the Hubble Space Telescope to find out if they’ve caught their first quarry. The possible candidate is a Neptune-sized object orbiting the planet Kepler 1625b (SN: 8/19/17, p. 15). If the candidate turns out to be a genuine exomoon — Kipping is quick to point out that similar hints have fizzled before — he will no doubt solidify his reputation as “the moon guy.”\\nBut he dabbles in a lot of things. “I write a lot of failed papers,” he admits. He arrived at exomoons by following a simple philosophy: No idea is too crazy.\\n“His signature projects are quite risky, but with obvious large payback,” says Dimitar Sasselov, director of the Harvard Origins of Life Initiative, who worked with Kipping in his postdoc research at Harvard University.\\nKipping, now 33, grew up in a small town in England. He loved Star Trek, wanted to be an astronaut and memorized the names and masses of all the planets in the solar system — and their moons.\\nSupportive teachers encouraged him to pursue a career in physics at a time when exoplanet research was just starting to be taken seriously. By 2003, when he was an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, there were a few dozen known exoplanets. But there are 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. “It felt like there was a huge wave of discovery waiting to happen,” Kipping says.\\nSix years later, NASA launched Kepler and within five years, the number of known exoplanets ballooned to well over 1,000.\\nAll the planets Kepler has picked up made themselves known by blocking their star’s light as they crossed, or transited, in front of the star. Those transits produce a characteristic U-shape in graphs of starlight over time. As a graduate student at University College London, Kipping considered what the U-shaped graphs might reveal about the planets. Researchers already knew that deeper U’s mean larger planets, for example. More frequent U’s mean shorter orbital periods.\\nWhile staring at the stars on a hiking trip in the Himalayas, Kipping thought of something else that could change the U. “It was just obvious to me that a moon could screw it up,” he says. A large enough moon would create an occasional extra dip in the light.\\nIn the early days of the exoplanet boom, actually looking for such dips in the Kepler data was an audacious notion. But Kipping jumped in anyway. “I assumed it would be a tiny effect, but it turned out to be detectable,” Kipping says. His paper, published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in 2009, pointed out that Kepler could be used to search for exomoons, too.\\nTo pursue the search in earnest, Kipping taught himself new data processing techniques. The problem proved so computationally intensive that he turned to crowdfunding to buy a supercomputer while a postdoc at Harvard. His hunt caught on in the popular press, with write-ups in Time magazine and Wired. And other scientists joined the chase as well, with several more groups announcing competing searches in the past few years.\\nThere’s a reason Kipping’s team has found only one exomoon candidate so far: There aren’t many out there big enough for Kepler to see, according to his statistical work. “Because he’s doing such a careful job, it probably means something,” Sasselov adds. The systems the team has checked that show no moons most likely aren’t hiding any.\\nAs a new faculty member at Columbia, Kipping has lately turned his attention to teaching, mentoring and outreach. Many of his students say he supports their wildest pursuits — even those outside astronomy, like machine learning or linguistics.\\n“He’s known for out-there ideas,” says current graduate student Moiya McTier, who first worked with Kipping as an undergrad student in the Banneker Institute at Harvard, a program to prepare students of color for careers in astronomy. “Which is great, because I don’t feel afraid of going to him with my own crazy ideas.”\\nKipping’s latest experiment is a YouTube channel aimed at nonscientists. “Outreach isn’t really rewarded in the academic world,” he says. “It’s a thing I wouldn’t have done as a postdoc, but felt it was a risk I was willing to take as a faculty member.”\\nIt has paid unexpected scientific dividends already. While preparing a video about the Breakthrough Starshot initiative, which aims to send tiny spacecraft at 20 percent the speed of light to visit the nearest star to the sun (SN: 9/2/17, p. 4), Kipping realized there was an error in the Breakthrough team’s calculations of the photon pressure needed to propel the craft. The error connected back to Albert Einstein’s 1905 paper about special relativity and came from some assumptions made for simplicity that wouldn’t hold in real life.\\nKipping’s paper discussing the error was published in June in the Astronomical Journal.\\n“I would never have written a paper about special relativity if I hadn’t been doing outreach about Starshot,” he says. His philosophy makes more sense every year: Let all the crazy in.

      "﻿Many books about science are meant to be pleasure reading. Such books attempt to convey the wonder and fascination and excitement of science, and ideally some of the substance as well. After all, good popular science writing is not only engaging and entertaining, but also informative. But even very informative popular books are not designed to be fully educational about the science in technical detail. Popularization by its very nature requires omission of detail and simplification in description.\\nAs a result, many readers of popular science never get a true picture of how intricate and deep the corpus of scientific knowledge can be. For physics in particular, the “big ideas” conveyed via clever analogies and metaphors rarely reveal the richness of the mathematical foundations underlying them. It is equally rare for writers who do include equations to dissect them and analyze how they are derived. After all, most authors early on were advised of the old publisher’s axiom that each equation cuts a book’s sales in half.\\nFortunately for those who like their physics raw, with the math uncensored, publishers sometimes rescind the keep-equations-to-a-minimum rule for books that remain accessible to dedicated readers interested in physical reality’s mathematical foundations.\\n\\nOne such book, Special Relativity and Classical Field Theory, is the third volume in Stanford University physicist Leonard Susskind’s “Theoretical Minimum” series. Previous volumes covered classical physics (SN: 4/20/13, p. 30) and quantum physics (SN: 6/14/14, p. 29). In the latest, Susskind (with Art Friedman) analyzes the mathematical apparatus of Einstein’s special theory of relativity, which describes matter in uniform motion, and the physics of fields, such as those explaining electricity, magnetism and associated phenomena.\\nAs in previous volumes, Susskind walks you through the basics of each topic and builds the necessary math from scratch. It helps if you’ve read the earlier books (especially the first, which focuses on classical mechanics). But either way, your prime requirement for getting much benefit from this book is comfort with sophisticated mathematics.\\nSusskind is meticulous in explaining each step of applying the equations to the physical phenomena he describes, and he excels in explaining why the math works the way it does. Nevertheless, if matrices and tensors and summation indices give you headaches, prepare for a migraine. If you’re intrepid enough, though, you’ll emerge with a much deeper appreciation for the true meaning of Einstein’s relativity, Maxwell’s equations and many other aspects of fundamental physics.\\nFor more detail (if perhaps less help), you could turn instead to The Physical World, by English physicists Nicholas Manton and Nicholas Mee. They have composed a treatise of impressive scope, encompassing all aspects of fundamental physics in one nearly 600-page volume. They start with the laws of motion and move on to Maxwell’s equations and fields, special and general relativity, quantum physics, atoms and molecules, thermodynamics, nuclear and particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. Their text is straightforward and clear but dry and technical — equations are often embedded in a sentence as though they were words. It’s not a recipe for speed reading, but it is a thorough presentation of the rigorous math underlying a vast spectrum of natural entities and phenomena.\\nBoth books emphasize the importance of variational principles in describing nature, such as the principle of least action. As Manton and Mee stress, “least action” refers to a certain efficiency in how nature operates; the principle is in many ways more fundamental than some physical laws. It applies in vastly diverse contexts; it even helps bridge the divide between classical and quantum physics. It is conceptually superior in that many other facts of physics (such as laws of motion) can be derived from it. But there is a cost, as Manton and Mee note: the need for “more sophisticated mathematical technology.” It’s simply inescapable that understanding the physical world precisely requires a grip on math that cannot be achieved without considerable mental effort.\\nBoth of these books require such effort — they are not recreational beach reads. But they do make the rewards of deeper understanding attainable for anyone sufficiently motivated to pay the price.\\nBuy Special Relativity and Classical Field Theory or The Physical World from Amazon.com.

      "﻿An imaging technique that freezes tiny biological objects such as proteins and viruses in place so that scientists can peer into their structures at the scale of atoms has won its developers the 2017 Nobel Prize in chemistry.\\nJacques Dubochet of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, Joachim Frank of Columbia University and Richard Henderson of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, won for their contributions to the development of the technique, called cryo-electron microscopy, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October 4. The three will share the 9-million-Swedish-kronor (about $1.1 million) prize.\\n“Now that we can see the intricate details of every drop of our body fluids, we can understand how they are built and how they act and how they work together,” Sara Snogerup Linse, chair of the 2017 chemistry Nobel committee, said at a news conference. “We are facing a revolution in biochemistry…. Soon, there are no more secrets.”\\nAndrew Murray, a systems biologist at Harvard University, applauded the choice. “These are people whose work lies at the basis of an incredibly important technique.” The award, he says, “recognizes people who’ve done science for science’s sake…. The ultimate goal is to see molecules up close and personal.”  \\nTo map the minute landscape of molecules, at scales as tiny as just tenths of a nanometer, and help decipher their functions, structural biologists have long relied on two tools: nuclear magnetic resonance, or NMR, spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. But both techniques have limitations. X-ray crystallography creates a 3-D picture of a molecule’s structure by bouncing X-rays off of a crystallized version of a molecule and reconstructing the molecule’s structure based on those diffraction patterns. “But a lot of proteins cannot be crystallized, so their structures are inaccessible to the prying mind of the biochemist,” Murray says. NMR, meanwhile, allows researchers to study biological molecules in a solution, such as water — but its use has generally been limited to relatively small proteins.\\nEnter cryo-electron microscopy, or cryo-EM. In the 1970s, Henderson first attempted to use regular electron microscopy to study a protein embedded in the membrane of a cell. He was unable to crystallize the protein and didn’t want to remove it from the membrane and thereby risk altering its structure.\\nElectron microscopy wasn’t ideal for studying biological molecules. This technique works by shining a beam of electrons through a sample and observing how the electrons are deflected by the material they’ve passed through. The pattern of those deflections sketches out the material’s atomic structure. But the powerful electron beams can incinerate the material as they pass through it, weakening the beam and producing fuzzy images. Another drawback: The material must be in a vacuum in the microscope and that causes water within biological molecules to evaporate, distorting their shapes.\\nTo get around these problems, in 1975 Henderson placed bacterial proteins, still within their membrane so that they retained their structures, within the microscope and covered the membrane with a glucose solution to keep it from drying out. He used a weaker electron beam to minimize the damage. Because the beam was weaker, the images were fuzzier than they would have been with a beam at full strength. But since the proteins in his sample happened to be oriented in the same direction, Henderson was able to compile the fuzzy images from each protein in the membrane to generate one sharper image. He then turned the membrane this way and that, capturing the proteins in different orientations and compiling those 2-D images to see the protein’s structure in three dimensions. The image, while an improvement over past efforts, wasn’t quite at the atomic scale yet — that required other advances.\\nOne such advance came from Frank, who was tackling the issue of orientation. Unlike Henderson’s proteins, most proteins in a sample wouldn’t all be oriented in the same direction and conveniently ready to compile. Frank’s solution, published in 1981, was to create a computer algorithm to scan the images to look for any proteins oriented in the same direction and group them together. Like Henderson’s compiled image, each group in Frank’s image would be compiled to create a sharper picture.  \\nMeanwhile, Dubochet was considering the problem of dehydration. Henderson’s glucose solution wouldn’t work for most biomolecules. Freezing samples also wouldn’t work, because ice crystals distort molecules’ shapes. But, he realized, if the water were to cool extremely rapidly to ‒196 ° Celsius — in ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen — it would solidify without forming ice crystals, instead becoming vitreous, or glassy. In 1984, he showed that viruses, when covered with a fine layer of vitrified water, could be safely studied in the electron microscope.\\nThat cryo-EM technique dovetailed with Henderson’s efforts, and in 1990, Henderson produced the first cryo-EM image of a protein at the atomic scale. The following year, Frank prepared ribosomes, cellular structures that help make proteins, using the cryo-EM method. But for some time, the resolution of the images remained unsatisfying enough that many researchers called it “blobology.”\\nOver time, however, other researchers have built on those innovations to improve that resolution with better optics, detectors and computational techniques. In 2015, structural biologist Sriram Subramaniam of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., reported improving the resolutionof cryo-EM images to an ultrafine 0.22-nanometer scale — finally rivaling the impressive resolution of images produced by X-ray crystallography, the current gold standard.\\n“Now, we need to apply this to look at larger complexes to understand how these different molecular machines work,” Subramaniam says.\\nOver the last few years, cryo-EM has begun to demonstrate its potential, including revealing the structure of larger and larger objects, such as viruses. In 2016, cryo-EM was used to map the structure of the Zika virus (SN: 4/30/16, p. 10), helping to identify possible regions to target with a vaccine or antiviral compounds.\\n“Cryo-EM has revolutionized structural biology, particularly in the last three years, with the invention of new kinds of electron detectors for the microscope,” says Michael Rossmann, a physicist and microbiologist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., and a coauthor of the Zika mapping study. “We call it the ‘resolution revolution.’” Next up, he says: looking at an entire cell.\\nNotes Subramaniam: “This is just the beginning. There are exciting years ahead.”\\n\\n
