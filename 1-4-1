1. 

I would break the sample into a placebo group and a group that is given the new sleep aid. Then track their sleep with a device like a fitbit.

2.

I would have the recruiters/ sales team alternate between a sample of the new uniforms and their old. I would attempt to randomize it so that day of the week, weather, individual's performance, and the demographic of the person they are selling to would create comparable sample sizes. Then I would look at sales activity to compare.

3.

I would create a new homepage and either send out an advertisement with half of the ads having a link to the old homepage and the other half to the new. I would then compare sales, views, duration, etc.

4.

I would send out half of the emails with 'please read' in the title and half without then look at the click volume.
